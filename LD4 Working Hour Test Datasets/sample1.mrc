Nickel oxide (NiO[subscript]x) offers promising characteristics for a winning hole transport layer (HTL), such as high optical transmittance, high stability, easy processability, and a wide band gap that allows high hole mobility and good electron blocking ability. In this work, NiOx was synthesized by first forming Ni(OH)₂ in the precipitation reaction of (Ni(NO₃)₂· 6H₂O) and NaOH. The synthesized NiO[subscript]x nanocrystals was dissolved in DI water to different concentrations and used as a HTL in the inverted p-i-n CsSnI₃ PVSCs. The effects of annealing condition, concentration of NiO[subscript]x ink and spin speed on the NiOx film morphology and surface roughness were explored. In addition, CsSnI₃ thin films were fabricated to be the active layer and solar cells with the inverted structure were fabricated and tested.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed September 21, 2020). 0aPerovskite solar cells. 0aNickel oxide. 7aPerovskite solar cells.2fast0(OCoLC)fst02009247 7aNickel oxide.2fast0(OCoLC)fst018947720 aChemical engineering 4aThesesxChemical engineering. 7aAcademic theses2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aYu, Qiuming,d1963-edegree supervisor.40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/45886  aWAUW03505cam a2200505 i 45000010011000000080041000110060019000520050017000710070014000880400051001021000027001532450115001802640063002952640011003583000070003693360026004393370026004653380036004913470021005273470008005485020049005565040055006055201586006605880099022466500048023456500021023936500025024146500012024396500038024516500051024896500047025406500074025876530021026616530026026826530018027086530027027266530023027536530025027766550034028016550046028356550028028817000044029098560037029530490009029901195708110200914t20202020waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20210120172538.2cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdWAUdOCLCFdOCLdOCLCO1 aBoese, Julia,eauthor.10aExploiting the interactions of solid binding proteins with silica to form colloidal assemblies /cJulia Boese. 1a[Seattle] :b[University of Washington Libraries],c[2020] 4c©2020  a1 online resource (ix, 57 pages) :billustrations (chiefly color)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext file2rdaft  bPDF  bM.S.

When genetically encoded within proteins, SBPs can function as linkers to create hybrid materials comprising inorganic components and the proteins to which they are fused. Here, we show how such solid binding proteins may be employed to achieve dynamic control over the assembly and disassembly of silica nanoparticles and how the process is influenced by SBP sequence, insertion point within the protein, and solution conditions. Using fluorescent-resonant energy transfer (FRET), dynamic light scattering (DLS) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), we show that bifunctional derivatives of superfolder green fluorescent protein (sfGFP) engineered with two strong, or with a strong and a weak silica-binding peptide support the pH-dependent aggregation and disaggregation of rhodamine-containing silica nanoparticle (RhSiNP). We further demonstrate that pH shifts can be used to cycle nanoparticles between assembled and dispersed states and that aggregate size can be tuned with different SBPs, NP sizes, and salt concentrations. Additionally, we designed multimeric de novo and natural proteins for increased control over the pattering of silica nanoparticles (SiNPs) and designed ZnS binding and cysteine binding sfGFP for the association of QDs into protein-linked nanomaterials. This new paradigm for the synthesis of dynamic nanoparticle systems should find applications in biosensing, diagnostics, and advanced materials.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed September 14, 2020). 0aPeptidesxStructure-activity relationships. 0aProtein binding. 0aProtein engineering. 0aSilica. 7aSilica.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01118585 7aProtein engineering.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01079685 7aProtein binding.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01079673 7aPeptidesxStructure-activity relationships.2fast0(OCoLC)fst010575790 aHybrid materials0 aNanomaterial assembly0 aNanoparticles0 aSolid Binding peptides0 aStimuli dependence0 aChemical engineering 4aThesesxChemical engineering. 7aAcademic theses2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aBaneyx, François,edegree supervisor.40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/45876  aWAUW02955cam a2200505 i 45000010011000000080041000110060019000520050017000710070014000880400051001021000036001532450078001892640063002672640011003303000060003413360026004013370026004273380036004533470021004893470008005105020042005185040055005605201144006155880099017596500029018586500014018876500018019016500017019196500043019366500040019796500044020196530033020636530024020966530027021206530036021476530019021836530025022026530025022276550034022526550046022866550028023327000040023608560040024000490009024401196340746200921t20202020waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20210120172829.0cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdOCLCFdWAUdOCLdOCLCO1 aBonageri, Shrilakshmi,eauthor.10aData classification in high throughput screening /cShrilakshmi Bonageri. 1a[Seattle] :b[University of Washington Libraries],c[2020] 4c©2020  a1 online resource (ix, 79 pages) :bcolor illustrations  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext file2rdaft  bPDF  bM.S.cUniversity of Washingtond2020.  aIncludes bibliographical references (pages 76-79).3 aRedox flow batteries offer an economical, low vulnerability means to store electrical energy at grid scale. Most commercial flow batteries use concentrated sulphuric acid with vanadium as the active redox material. While they have many inherent benefits, the use of vanadium drives up their cost. Deep eutectic solvents (DESs) are promising electrolyte solvents for less expensive and more sustainable organic redox species due to their biodegradability, low cost, high solvent quality and molecular versatility. High throughput screening (HTS) was used to synthesize and measure thermal and electrochemical properties of DESs to rapidly find an optimum DES for use in redox flow batteries. As a vast amount of data with varying characteristics based on the samples being tested is produced, data classification is essential to automate data analysis. Thus, convolutional neural networks and long short term memory networks were successfully used to classify HTS data into predefined categories and eliminate noisy data. Suitable data analysis techniques were then developed for each category of classified data to obtain accurate results.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed September 21, 2020). 0aFlow batteriesxTesting. 0aSolvents. 0aElectrolytes. 0aVoltammetry. 7aVoltammetry.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01168951 7aSolvents.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01125677 7aElectrolytes.2fast0(OCoLC)fst009064890 aConvolutional neural network0 aData classification0 aDeep eutectic solvents0 aHigh throughput experimentation0 aNeural network0 aRedox flow batteries0 aChemical engineering 4aThesesxChemical engineering. 7aAcademic theses2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aPozzo, Lilo D.,edegree supervisor.4070uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/45888  aWAUW02676cam a2200469 i 45000010011000000080041000110060019000520050017000710070014000880400051001020660007001531000034001602450070001942640063002642640011003273000067003383360026004053370026004313380036004573470021004933470008005145020049005225040055005715880087006266500026007136500032007396500044007716500058008156500052008736530016009256530018009416530021009596530022009806530025010026550034010276550046010616550028011077000058011358560037011938800967012300490009021971196340223200921t20202020waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20210120172747.7cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdOCLCFdWAUdOCLdOCLCO  c(S1 aChen, Guoyao,d1995-eauthor.12aA high-resolution 3D printable porous biomaterial /cGuoyao Chen. 1a[Seattle] :b[University of Washington Libraries],c[2020] 4c©2020  a1 online resource (vi, 40 pages) :billustrations (some color)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext file2rdaft  bPDF  bM.S.

A porous biomaterial with 40μm pore size has been found to have good performance in reducing the foreign body reaction upon implantation, and since the inner structure is regular, a stereolithography 3D printing system was tried to print this high-resolution structure. This work has demonstrated with the laser intensity at 1Ã 10-6% and the writing speed at 1mm/s, the top surface of this structure can be printed with the commercially available resin DS2000, but the side faces cannot be properly printed due to the photo sensitiveness of the resin. The top surface of a complex and large shape, an insulin pump catheter, was also printed well. A few 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) based formulas have also been tried in the printer, though further optimization is needed to accurately print high resolution structures with HEMA.  aWAUW03470cam a2200541 i 45000010011000000080041000110060019000520050017000710070014000880400051001021000035001532450141001882640063003292640011003923000067004033360026004703370026004963380036005223470021005583470008005795020042005875040057006295201496006865880099021826500016022816500035022976500024023326500032023566500042023886500061024306500058024916500050025496530007025996530013026066530011026196530007026306530007026376530018026446530022026626530011026846530025026956550034027206550046027546550028028007000051028288560040028790490009029191196339840200921t20202020waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20210120172953.3cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdOCLCFdWAUdOCLdOCLCO1 aChin, Jeffrey,d1988-eauthor.10aDouble cation substitution of CZTSSe constituents to reduce detrimental defects clusters and improve device performance /cJeffrey Chin. 1a[Seattle] :b[University of Washington Libraries],c[2020] 4c©2020  a1 online resource (30 unnumbered pages) :bcolor illustrations  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext file2rdaft  bPDF  bM.S.cUniversity of Washingtond2020.  aIncludes bibliographical references (pages [29-30]).3 aSolution processed thin-film photovoltaic (PV) technology is poised to be the future of manufacturing standard for commercially available solar energy modules due to the substantially low estimated capital expenditure (CAPEX) required. Over the decades, the concept of high efficiency CZTSSe has enticed researchers but always eluded their grasps. This report explores improving the device performance metrics of CZTSSe with the goal of improving the PCE in hopes that it become industrially disruptive to the currently adopted technologies. The approach taken in this research was to conduct double cation alloying with elements shown in literature to have beneficial impacts for CZTSSe device performance with the hypothesis that the combination would be complementary. First, we investigated the combination of small stoichiometric substitutions of Cu with Ag and Zn with Mn so that the resulting stoichiometry would resemble (Agx,Cu1-[subscript]x)2(Mn[subscript]yZn[subscript]1-y)Sn(S,Se)₄. Second we investigated the double cation substitution of Cu with Ag and Sn with Ge so that the already proven effects of Ge incorporation could be correlated with the effects of Ag. Collectively, the work included in this report demonstrates considerable progress exploring uncharted avenues toward increasing the performance of CZTSSe. By attempting a new approach to understanding optoelectronic performance and reliability in CZTSSe the goal of high efficiency CZTSSe may soon be attainable.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed September 21, 2020). 0aThin films. 0aPhotovoltaic power generation. 0aCopper-zinc alloys. 0aMetal oxide semiconductors. 7aThin films.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01150018 7aPhotovoltaic power generation.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01062167 7aMetal oxide semiconductors.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01017624 7aCopper-zinc alloys.2fast0(OCoLC)fst008785740 aAg0 aAlloying0 aCZTSSe0 aGe0 aMn0 aVoc deffiecit0 aMaterials Science0 aEnergy0 aChemical engineering 4aThesesxChemical engineering. 7aAcademic theses2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aHillhouse, Hugh W.,d1972-edegree supervisor.4070uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/45879  aWAUW
