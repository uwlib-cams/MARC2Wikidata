Nickel oxide (NiO[subscript]x) offers promising characteristics for a winning hole transport layer (HTL), such as high optical transmittance, high stability, easy processability, and a wide band gap that allows high hole mobility and good electron blocking ability. In this work, NiOx was synthesized by first forming Ni(OH)₂ in the precipitation reaction of (Ni(NO₃)₂· 6H₂O) and NaOH. The synthesized NiO[subscript]x nanocrystals was dissolved in DI water to different concentrations and used as a HTL in the inverted p-i-n CsSnI₃ PVSCs. The effects of annealing condition, concentration of NiO[subscript]x ink and spin speed on the NiOx film morphology and surface roughness were explored. In addition, CsSnI₃ thin films were fabricated to be the active layer and solar cells with the inverted structure were fabricated and tested.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed September 21, 2020). 0aPerovskite solar cells. 0aNickel oxide. 7aPerovskite solar cells.2fast0(OCoLC)fst02009247 7aNickel oxide.2fast0(OCoLC)fst018947720 aChemical engineering 4aThesesxChemical engineering. 7aAcademic theses2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aYu, Qiuming,d1963-edegree supervisor.40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/45886  aWAUW03505cam a2200505 i 45000010011000000080041000110060019000520050017000710070014000880400051001021000027001532450115001802640063002952640011003583000070003693360026004393370026004653380036004913470021005273470008005485020049005565040055006055201586006605880099022466500048023456500021023936500025024146500012024396500038024516500051024896500047025406500074025876530021026616530026026826530018027086530027027266530023027536530025027766550034028016550046028356550028028817000044029098560037029530490009029901195708110200914t20202020waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20210120172538.2cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdWAUdOCLCFdOCLdOCLCO1 aBoese, Julia,eauthor.10aExploiting the interactions of solid binding proteins with silica to form colloidal assemblies /cJulia Boese. 1a[Seattle] :b[University of Washington Libraries],c[2020] 4c©2020  a1 online resource (ix, 57 pages) :billustrations (chiefly color)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext file2rdaft  bPDF  bM.S.

When genetically encoded within proteins, SBPs can function as linkers to create hybrid materials comprising inorganic components and the proteins to which they are fused. Here, we show how such solid binding proteins may be employed to achieve dynamic control over the assembly and disassembly of silica nanoparticles and how the process is influenced by SBP sequence, insertion point within the protein, and solution conditions. Using fluorescent-resonant energy transfer (FRET), dynamic light scattering (DLS) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), we show that bifunctional derivatives of superfolder green fluorescent protein (sfGFP) engineered with two strong, or with a strong and a weak silica-binding peptide support the pH-dependent aggregation and disaggregation of rhodamine-containing silica nanoparticle (RhSiNP). We further demonstrate that pH shifts can be used to cycle nanoparticles between assembled and dispersed states and that aggregate size can be tuned with different SBPs, NP sizes, and salt concentrations. Additionally, we designed multimeric de novo and natural proteins for increased control over the pattering of silica nanoparticles (SiNPs) and designed ZnS binding and cysteine binding sfGFP for the association of QDs into protein-linked nanomaterials. This new paradigm for the synthesis of dynamic nanoparticle systems should find applications in biosensing, diagnostics, and advanced materials.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed September 14, 2020). 0aPeptidesxStructure-activity relationships. 0aProtein binding. 0aProtein engineering. 0aSilica. 7aSilica.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01118585 7aProtein engineering.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01079685 7aProtein binding.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01079673 7aPeptidesxStructure-activity relationships.2fast0(OCoLC)fst010575790 aHybrid materials0 aNanomaterial assembly0 aNanoparticles0 aSolid Binding peptides0 aStimuli dependence0 aChemical engineering 4aThesesxChemical engineering. 7aAcademic theses2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aBaneyx, François,edegree supervisor.40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/45876  aWAUW02955cam a2200505 i 45000010011000000080041000110060019000520050017000710070014000880400051001021000036001532450078001892640063002672640011003303000060003413360026004013370026004273380036004533470021004893470008005105020042005185040055005605201144006155880099017596500029018586500014018876500018019016500017019196500043019366500040019796500044020196530033020636530024020966530027021206530036021476530019021836530025022026530025022276550034022526550046022866550028023327000040023608560040024000490009024401196340746200921t20202020waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20210120172829.0cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdOCLCFdWAUdOCLdOCLCO1 aBonageri, Shrilakshmi,eauthor.10aData classification in high throughput screening /cShrilakshmi Bonageri. 1a[Seattle] :b[University of Washington Libraries],c[2020] 4c©2020  a1 online resource (ix, 79 pages) :bcolor illustrations  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext file2rdaft  bPDF  bM.S.cUniversity of Washingtond2020.  aIncludes bibliographical references (pages 76-79).3 aRedox flow batteries offer an economical, low vulnerability means to store electrical energy at grid scale. Most commercial flow batteries use concentrated sulphuric acid with vanadium as the active redox material. While they have many inherent benefits, the use of vanadium drives up their cost. Deep eutectic solvents (DESs) are promising electrolyte solvents for less expensive and more sustainable organic redox species due to their biodegradability, low cost, high solvent quality and molecular versatility. High throughput screening (HTS) was used to synthesize and measure thermal and electrochemical properties of DESs to rapidly find an optimum DES for use in redox flow batteries. As a vast amount of data with varying characteristics based on the samples being tested is produced, data classification is essential to automate data analysis. Thus, convolutional neural networks and long short term memory networks were successfully used to classify HTS data into predefined categories and eliminate noisy data. Suitable data analysis techniques were then developed for each category of classified data to obtain accurate results.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed September 21, 2020). 0aFlow batteriesxTesting. 0aSolvents. 0aElectrolytes. 0aVoltammetry. 7aVoltammetry.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01168951 7aSolvents.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01125677 7aElectrolytes.2fast0(OCoLC)fst009064890 aConvolutional neural network0 aData classification0 aDeep eutectic solvents0 aHigh throughput experimentation0 aNeural network0 aRedox flow batteries0 aChemical engineering 4aThesesxChemical engineering. 7aAcademic theses2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aPozzo, Lilo D.,edegree supervisor.4070uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/45888  aWAUW02676cam a2200469 i 45000010011000000080041000110060019000520050017000710070014000880400051001020660007001531000034001602450070001942640063002642640011003273000067003383360026004053370026004313380036004573470021004933470008005145020049005225040055005715880087006266500026007136500032007396500044007716500058008156500052008736530016009256530018009416530021009596530022009806530025010026550034010276550046010616550028011077000058011358560037011938800967012300490009021971196340223200921t20202020waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20210120172747.7cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdOCLCFdWAUdOCLdOCLCO  c(S1 aChen, Guoyao,d1995-eauthor.12aA high-resolution 3D printable porous biomaterial /cGuoyao Chen. 1a[Seattle] :b[University of Washington Libraries],c[2020] 4c©2020  a1 online resource (vi, 40 pages) :billustrations (some color)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext file2rdaft  bPDF  bM.S.

A porous biomaterial with 40μm pore size has been found to have good performance in reducing the foreign body reaction upon implantation, and since the inner structure is regular, a stereolithography 3D printing system was tried to print this high-resolution structure. This work has demonstrated with the laser intensity at 1Ã 10-6% and the writing speed at 1mm/s, the top surface of this structure can be printed with the commercially available resin DS2000, but the side faces cannot be properly printed due to the photo sensitiveness of the resin. The top surface of a complex and large shape, an insulin pump catheter, was also printed well. A few 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) based formulas have also been tried in the printer, though further optimization is needed to accurately print high resolution structures with HEMA.  aWAUW03470cam a2200541 i 45000010011000000080041000110060019000520050017000710070014000880400051001021000035001532450141001882640063003292640011003923000067004033360026004703370026004963380036005223470021005583470008005795020042005875040057006295201496006865880099021826500016022816500035022976500024023326500032023566500042023886500061024306500058024916500050025496530007025996530013026066530011026196530007026306530007026376530018026446530022026626530011026846530025026956550034027206550046027546550028028007000051028288560040028790490009029191196339840200921t20202020waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20210120172953.3cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdOCLCFdWAUdOCLdOCLCO1 aChin, Jeffrey,d1988-eauthor.10aDouble cation substitution of CZTSSe constituents to reduce detrimental defects clusters and improve device performance /cJeffrey Chin. 1a[Seattle] :b[University of Washington Libraries],c[2020] 4c©2020  a1 online resource (30 unnumbered pages) :bcolor illustrations  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext file2rdaft  bPDF  bM.S.cUniversity of Washingtond2020.  aIncludes bibliographical references (pages [29-30]).3 aSolution processed thin-film photovoltaic (PV) technology is poised to be the future of manufacturing standard for commercially available solar energy modules due to the substantially low estimated capital expenditure (CAPEX) required. Over the decades, the concept of high efficiency CZTSSe has enticed researchers but always eluded their grasps. This report explores improving the device performance metrics of CZTSSe with the goal of improving the PCE in hopes that it become industrially disruptive to the currently adopted technologies. The approach taken in this research was to conduct double cation alloying with elements shown in literature to have beneficial impacts for CZTSSe device performance with the hypothesis that the combination would be complementary. First, we investigated the combination of small stoichiometric substitutions of Cu with Ag and Zn with Mn so that the resulting stoichiometry would resemble (Agx,Cu1-[subscript]x)2(Mn[subscript]yZn[subscript]1-y)Sn(S,Se)₄. Second we investigated the double cation substitution of Cu with Ag and Sn with Ge so that the already proven effects of Ge incorporation could be correlated with the effects of Ag. Collectively, the work included in this report demonstrates considerable progress exploring uncharted avenues toward increasing the performance of CZTSSe. By attempting a new approach to understanding optoelectronic performance and reliability in CZTSSe the goal of high efficiency CZTSSe may soon be attainable.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed September 21, 2020). 0aThin films. 0aPhotovoltaic power generation. 0aCopper-zinc alloys. 0aMetal oxide semiconductors. 7aThin films.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01150018 7aPhotovoltaic power generation.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01062167 7aMetal oxide semiconductors.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01017624 7aCopper-zinc alloys.2fast0(OCoLC)fst008785740 aAg0 aAlloying0 aCZTSSe0 aGe0 aMn0 aVoc deffiecit0 aMaterials Science0 aEnergy0 aChemical engineering 4aThesesxChemical engineering. 7aAcademic theses2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aHillhouse, Hugh W.,d1972-edegree supervisor.4070uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/45879  aWAUW03525cam a2200445 i 45000010011000000080041000110060019000520050017000710070014000880400051001021000028001532450084001812640063002652640011003283000066003393360026004053370026004313380036004573470021004933470008005145020049005225040055005715201883006265880099025096500015026086500013026236500015026366500027026516500039026786500041027176500053027586500041028116530025028526550034028776550046029116550028029577000048029858560037030330490009030701195712907200914t20202020waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20210120172459.1cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdWAUdOCLCFdOCLdOCLCO1 aGu, Ge,d1996-eauthor.10aSupercritical fluid-liquid-solid growth of alloyed Si1-xGex nanowires /cGe Gu. 1a[Seattle] :b[University of Washington Libraries],c[2020] 4c©2020  a1 online resource (v, 30 pages) :billustrations (some color)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext file2rdaft  bPDF  bM.S.

However, one significant challenge of their practical implementation is the large volume change associated with the insertion and extraction of lithium ions, which results in mechanical pulverization and capacity fade. Nanostructuring active material morphology has been demonstrated as a strategy to compensate for volume change and improve capacity and cycle life in lithium ion batteries. Although Si has the highest theoretical capacity among elemental lithium ion battery negative electrodes and maintains distinct advantages as an electrode material, silicon's rate capability is hindered by its lower ionic diffusivity and electronic conductivity in comparison to Ge. However, Ge is much more expensive, which could limit its widespread use in anodes for lithium ion batteries. In an effort to capitalize on the benefits of both materials, there has been recent interest in developing an anode that combines the excellent rate capability of Ge with the high capacity and lower cost of Si. Recent efforts have demonstrated the ability to synthesize alloyed Si1-xGex nanowires (NWs) via a solution-based mechanism, using a thin film of tin to seed nanowire growth. In order to improve the scalability of this process, here we report the supercritical fluid-based synthesis of Sn nanocrystal-seeded alloyed Si1-xGex NWs. By balancing reaction parameters such as precursor reactivity, the semiconductor precursor to metal seed ratio, Si:Ge precursor ratio, and reaction temperature, we demonstrate the ability to synthesize alloyed Si1-xGex NWs through a colloidal, supercritical fluid-based process for the first time.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed September 14, 2020). 0aNanowires. 0aSilicon. 0aGermanium. 0aLithium ion batteries. 7aSilicon.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01118631 7aNanowires.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01032641 7aLithium ion batteries.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01764640 7aGermanium.2fast0(OCoLC)fst009420780 aChemical engineering 4aThesesxChemical engineering. 7aAcademic theses2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aHolmberg, Vincent Carl,edegree supervisor.40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/45877  aWAUW04694cam a2200397 i 45000010011000000080041000110060019000520050017000710070014000880400051001020660007001531000035001602450110001952640063003052640011003683000068003793360026004473370026004733380036004993470021005353470008005565020049005645040055006135880099006686500057007676500037008246500063008616530025009246550034009496550046009836550028010297000048010578560037011058803145011420490009042871196340715200921t20202020waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20210115175134.5cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdOCLCFdWAUdOCLdOCLCO  c(S1 aHsu, Chih-Wei,d1995-eauthor.10aData science approaches for tracking electrochemical reactions and phase transformations /cChih-Wei Hsu. 1a[Seattle] :b[University of Washington Libraries],c[2020] 4c©2020  a1 online resource (vii, 42 pages) :billustrations (some color)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext file2rdaft  bPDF  bM.S.

However, fully utilizing the data obtained via battery characterization, particularly battery cycling can be difficult, because so many data points are produced during battery cycling. A more recent innovation in battery characterization is to leverage data science to more fully utilize information obtained during various battery cycling protocols. Herein, we introduce two examples of using data science approaches combined with the battery characterization to maximize the value of the characterization data: total differential capacity (dQ/dV) plots and galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT). Total differential capacity plots are a powerful tool for understanding battery degradation when combined with various characterization techniques. However, due to the large amount of data, it is difficult to obtain quantitative conclusions via visual analysis, the typical approach for total differential capacity analysis. As a result, a data science approach was proposed to support quantitative conclusions for total differential capacity analysis. Herein, a software package has been developed to quantitatively analyze the battery cycling data from the dQ/dV plots. In addition, a user interface was built up and some documentations and demonstrations were set up to help the users have a better understanding of the codes and make it more accessible to use. Besides the application in tracking the electrochemical reactions within the battery, data science can also be combined with GITT to extract thermodynamic and kinetic data from a battery. This work focuses on generalizing a previously developed novel GITT model that accurately determined the lithium ion diffusions coefficient for a two-phase lithium iron phosphate electrode, so that the model can readily be applied to any phase transformation battery electrode (LiFePO₄) system. We validate our generalized tool both by replicating the data from the previous work and using the generalized tool to determine the sodium ions diffusion coefficients in the two-phase region during the sodium antimonide (Na₃Sb) battery charge-discharge cycling. In the standard GITT diffusivity model, the diffusion coefficients can appear to be many of magnitude lower in the two-phase region. This apparent drop occurs because phase transformation is not considered in the GITT diffusivity model. Therefore, the novel phase transformation GITT diffusivity model that we develop into a tool in this work takes both the diffusion and the interface migration into account. By solving the 1-D diffusion partial differential equations (PDEs) with the corresponding moving boundary conditions, the concentration profile, and the diffusion coefficients in both α and β phase can be determined. The diffusion coefficients obtained by the new model in the two-phase region are about 10⁻¹⁵~ 10⁻¹⁴ cm²/s for α and β phase, which is validated by the similarity of the diffusion coefficients calculated by the standard model in the single-phase region.  aWAUW04262cam a2200553 i 45000010011000000080041000110060019000520050017000710070014000880400058001021000025001602450111001852640063002962640011003593000093003703360026004633370026004893380036005153470021005513470008005725020044005805040057006245202183006815880094028646500041029586500019029996500018030186500021030366500068030576500047031256500067031726500045032396500044032846530018033286530012033466530019033586530018033776530022033956530025034176530025034426530018034676530019034856550034035046550047035386550028035857000049036138560037036620490009036991244817602210405t20202020waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20210714142827.9cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdOCLCOdOCLCFdWAUdOCLCOdOCL1 aLiao, Rick,eauthor.10aAntioxidant-loaded nanoparticles for the treatment of excitotoxicity in neurological disease /cRick Liao. 1a[Seattle] :b[University of Washington Libraries],c[2020] 4c©2020  a1 online resource (2 unnumbered pages, viii, 117 pages) :billustrations (chiefly color)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext file2rdaft  bPDF  bPh.

In acute neurological injury, a process known as excitotoxicity manifests from energy failure or direct trauma, causing overexcitation of neurons that leads to neuronal toxicity. Following neuronal death, toxic metabolites and cellular debris accumulate in the brain, perpetuating excitotoxicity to neighboring neurons. Despite the heavy social and economic toll and extensive research into neurotherapeutic development, there are currently no approved therapeutics for targeting excitotoxicity after acute neurological injury. The difficulty in clinical translation is largely attributed to several barriers intrinsic to the brain, including traversing the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and diffusion through the brain parenchyma. Therefore, in addition to understanding the biological complexity of the brain, developing effective therapeutics is a drug delivery problem. To expedite the pre-clinical research process, we have developed a tailorable organotypic whole hemisphere (OWH) brain slice model, capable of mimicking in vivo processes including excitotoxity and neuroinflammation. Using OWH models, we can systematically study disease processes and screen therapeutics in a high-throughput fashion, bypassing delivery obstacles. To improve therapeutic enzyme delivery, we have developed brain-penetrating antioxidant enzyme-loaded polymeric nanoparticles that inhibit enzymatic degradation. Furthermore, via nanoparticle screening on the OWH model, we have elucidated the toxicity of a common polymeric nanoparticle formulation involving poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) and sonication, and developed alternative biocompatible nanoparticle formulations. Finally, the OWH model has enabled detailed observation of disease-dependent nanoparticle-microglia interactions that can better inform drug delivery strategies. Throughout these studies, we have implemented a transdisciplinary approach that emphasizes thorough understanding of the neurobiology of disease and leverages chemical engineering fundamentals, to ultimately advance neurotherapeutic development.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed April 5, 2021). 0aNervous systemxDiseasesxTreatment. 0aNanoparticles. 0aAntioxidants. 0aNeurotoxicology.12aNervous System Diseasesxphysiopathology.0(DNLM)D009422Q000503 7aNeurotoxicology.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01036560 7aNervous systemxDiseasesxTreatment.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01036124 7aNanoparticles.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01032624 7aAntioxidants.2fast0(OCoLC)fst008106420 aDrug delivery0 aEnzymes0 aExcitotoxicity0 aNanoparticles0 aNeuroinflammation0 aNeurological disease0 aChemical engineering0 aNeurosciences0 aNanotechnology 4aThesesxChemical engineering. 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aNance, Elizabeth,d1985-edegree supervisor.40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/46396  aWAUW02132cam a2200409 i 45000010011000000080041000110060019000520050017000710070014000880400051001021000033001532450090001862640063002762640011003393000060003503360026004103370026004363380036004623470021004983470008005195020042005275040055005695200577006245880099012016500020013006500023013206500042013436500068013856500046014536530025014996550034015246550046015586550028016047000041016328560040016730490009017131196339786200921t20202020waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20210120172332.0cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdOCLCFdWAUdOCLdOCLCO1 aLiu, Kailei,d1994-eauthor.10aProtein-bound uremic toxin kinetics modeling for a new dialysis device /cKailei Liu. 1a[Seattle] :b[University of Washington Libraries],c[2020] 4c©2020  a1 online resource (iv, 21 pages) :bcolor illustrations  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext file2rdaft  bPDF  bM.S.cUniversity of Washingtond2020.  aIncludes bibliographical references (pages 19-21).3 aAddition to the conventional hemodialysis, a protein-bound uremic toxins process device is designed.

The electronic, optical, and mechanical properties of semiconductor nanowires can be considerably different than their bulk counterparts, making them attractive for a range of applications including sensors, energy storage, and quantum information systems. Solution-based synthesis is a promising strategy to produce semiconductor nanowires in a scalable, cost-effective matter. However, many solution-based methods are limited in their ability to produce nanowires with increasingly complex compositions-including doped, alloyed, and heterostructured architectures-as well as to rapidly screen synthetic parameters for combinatorial discovery and optimization. In addition, chemistries and growth dynamics can be difficult to track with nanowire syntheses that require high temperature and extreme pressure equipment. Moreover, the widespread integration of semiconductor nanowires into devices will also require new methods of assembly as well as careful consideration of surface chemistry. After an introduction to current methods of semiconductor nanowire synthesis, existing tactics for nanowire assembly, and strategies to improve the energy density of lithium ion batteries with group IV nanomaterials, this dissertation will cover three main topics related to (i) new synthetic methods for nanowire growth, (ii) a novel light-based nanowire assembly process, and (iii) the integration of nanowires into high-energy-density composite electrodes for lithium ion batteries. Herein, we demonstrate a new continuous-flow, laser-driven, nanowire growth process that exploits the light absorption of colloidal metal nanocrystals to drive semiconductor nanowire growth in an optically accessible reactor on the benchtop, potentially opening the door for both rapid screening of synthetic parameters as well as in situ studies of nanowire growth dynamics. Investigations of solution-based nanowire growth using this system establish that laser-driven syntheses can achieve rapid, on-demand growth of semiconductor nanowires. Importantly, the integration of nanowires into future device architectures will require a wide range of assembly strategies. While current solution-based nanowire assembly processes struggle to create deterministic heterojunctions, here, we demonstrate a novel example of nanowire assembly in a high-Prandtl-number organic solvent system, using an optical trap to orient, align, and "solder" metal-seeded semiconductor nanowires into periodic axial heterostructures. Finally, we investigate the role of surface functionalization on the integration of group-IV nanowires into high-capacity alloying electrodes for lithium ion batteries. We demonstrate that interfacial chemistry affects electrochemical access to different phases of lithiated germanium, and by carefully controlling the nanowire surface chemistry, we eliminate the need for the fluorinated electrolyte additives typically required for the stable cycling of group-IV-based, lithium-ion battery electrodes. In addition, we demonstrate that by balancing precursor decomposition kinetics, alloyed silicon-germanium (SiGe) nanowires can be synthesized through supercritical-fluid-based processes, potentially improving the rate capability of high-capacity silicon-based electrode materials produced via scalable processes. We anticipate that the information gained from these solution-based synthetic methods, assembly techniques, and surface chemistry studies will inform synthetic compositional control, elucidate relationships between solution-based reaction parameters and emergent properties, and advance the integration of solution-grown semiconductor nanowires into next-generation devices.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed May 18, 2020). 0aNanowires. 0aSemiconductors. 0aSilicon. 0aGermanium. 7aSilicon.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01118631 7aSemiconductors.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01112198 7aNanowires.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01032641 7aGermanium.2fast0(OCoLC)fst009420780 aAssembly0 aBatteries0 aNanowires0 aSemiconductor0 aSynthesis0 aChemical engineering0 aNanoscience 4aThesesxChemical engineering. 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aHolmberg, Vincent Carl,edegree supervisor.40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/45457  aWAUW03082cam a2200505 i 45000010011000000060019000110080041000300050017000710070014000880400046001021000038001482450143001862640063003292640011003923000089004033360026004923370026005183380036005443470021005803470008006015020049006095040055006585201165007135880094018786500028019726500014020006500024020146500040020386500050020786500054021286530027021826530025022096530024022346530035022586530017022936530026023106530016023366530025023526550034023776550047024116550028024587000044024868560037025300490009025671244554965m     o  d s      210402t20202020waua    obm  s000 0 eng d20210506221600.9cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdWAUdOCLCOdOCLCF1 aRamakrishnan, Shripathi,eauthor.10aHighly efficient all-polymer solar cells based on wide bandgap donor copolymers containing selenophene moieties /cShripathi Ramakrishnan. 1a[Seattle] :b[University of Washington Libraries],c[2020] 4c©2020  a1 online resource (2 unnumbered pages, v, 73 pages) :billustrations (chiefly color)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext file2rdaft  bPDF  bM.S.

Compared to PBDB-S, PBDBS-T displayed a narrower bandgap and red-shifted absorption owing to an upshifted HOMO by 0.13 eV. Both donors displayed significantly enhanced hole mobilities compared to PBDB-T, resulting in significantly higher photocurrent values of 17.51 mA/cm2 and 18.31 mA/cm2. Additionally, the superior crystallinity, and phase-separated morphology conferred by PBDBS-T resulted in efficient exciton dissociation and charge transport, enabling greater fill factors up to 63.5% and 9.5% efficiency. These results indicate that a selenophene p-spacer in a D-A polymeric backbone is beneficial to the photovoltaic properties, photophysics, and morphology of all-PSCs and is a promising molecular design strategy to develop highly efficient all-PSCs.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed April 2, 2021). 0aSolar cellsxMaterials. 0aPolymers. 0aSelenium compounds. 7aPolymers.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01070588 7aSelenium compounds.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01111416 7aSolar cellsxMaterials.2fast0(OCoLC)fst011249410 aAll-Polymer Solar Cell0 aCrystallinity tuning0 aDevice optimization0 aDonor polymer molecular design0 aPhotophysics0 aSelenophene pi-spacer0 aEngineering0 aChemical engineering 4aThesesxChemical engineering. 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aJenekhe, Samson A.,edegree supervisor.40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/46393  aWAUW03581cam a2200469 i 45000010011000000080041000110060019000520050017000710070014000880400044001021000036001462450105001822640063002872640011003503000068003613360026004293370026004553380036004813470021005173470008005385000010005465020044005565040041006005201846006415880093024876500026025806500026026066500025026326500027026576500052026846500053027366500052027896530025028416530022028666530025028886550034029136550047029476550028029947000043030228560037030650490009031021154646404200518t20202020waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20200716184204.8cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdWAUdOCLCFdOCL1 aRuskowitz, Emily Rose,eauthor.10aPhotochemical and logic-based regulation over the cellular microenvironment /cEmily Rose Ruskowitz. 1a[Seattle] :b[University of Washington Libraries],c[2020] 4c©2020  a1 online resource (vi, 150 pages) :billustrations (some color)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext file2rdaft  bPDF  aVita.  bPh.

By better understanding how well-defined combinations of individual biochemical signals including proteins presented in this space operate in (a)synchrony to direct cellular and integrated tissue function, we can begin to unravel irregularities within diseased systems and utilize this information to engineer therapies that promote healthy recovery. As photochemical reactions can be uniquely modulated in time and space, this dissertation develops and subsequently exploits novel light-based strategies to spatiotemporally control biochemical microenvironments and cellular signaling. First, we establish the cytocompatibility of near-ultraviolet light treatments common to photochemical manipulation through mammalian cell survival assays and global proteomic analyses. Expanding on existing concepts of photoresponsive drug delivery, we then introduce a generalizable strategy to govern biochemical signal presentation within biomaterials in response to precise combinations of environmental factors following user-programmable Boolean logic. Finally, we introduce the first genetically encoded protein-protein photoligation chemistry, and demonstrate its utility in irreversibly directing protein binding, function, and interactions both intra- and extracellularly. Employing this versatile photoreaction, we demonstrate 3D patterned immobilization of full-length proteins within biomaterials and user-guided intracellular protein activity. Such newly afforded 4D control over biological systems is expected to further basic biological understanding and advance medicine through enhanced tissue engineering and therapeutic delivery approaches.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed May 18, 2020). 0aBiomedical materials. 0aPhotonicsxMaterials. 0aPolymersxMaterials. 0aDrug delivery systems. 7aPhotonicsxMaterials.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01062075 7aDrug delivery systems.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00898667 7aBiomedical materials.2fast0(OCoLC)fst008325860 aBiomedical Materials0 aProtein Chemistry0 aChemical engineering 4aThesesxChemical engineering. 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aDeForest, Cole A.,edegree supervisor.40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/45455  aWAUW03429cam a2200445 i 45000010011000000080041000110060019000520050017000710070014000880400053001021000040001552450105001952640063003002640011003633000076003743360026004503370026004763380036005023470021005383470008005595020049005675040055006165201810006715880093024816500044025746500022026186530021026406530031026616530017026926530021027096530015027306530009027456530025027546550034027796550047028136550028028607000049028888560037029370490009029741244817250210405t20202020waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20210716171246.7cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdOCLCOdOCLCFdWAUdOCLCO1 aShackelford, David,d1992-eauthor.10aComparing machine learning classification methods for biological tracking data /cDavid Shackelford. 1a[Seattle] :b[University of Washington Libraries],c[2020] 4c©2020  a1 online resource (3 unnumbered pages, 49 pages) :bcolor illustrations  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext file2rdaft  bPDF  bM.S.

The additional use of machine learning (ML) methods has previously been proven successful in classifying both single particle tracking and MPT data for many biological systems. In order to further utilize collected MPT data for studies focused on nanoparticle diffusion within biological environments, a new predictive package, referred to as diff_predictor was developed in this study. This package uses feature and trajectory datasets, along with prediction methods such as XGBoost, recurrent neural networks, and random forest decision trees, to make predictions and classifications about the biological environment and nanoparticle behavior. To apply diff_predictor, I took a threefold approach: First, an extreme gradient boosting decision tree (XGBoost) was applied to a study of diffusion in a developing region within the brain to predict age based on spatial features. The features used in classification were analyzed for importance using Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) values. Second, a long short-term memory recurrent neural network algorithm was used on the temporal data from the same dataset and the results were compared with XGBoost and random forest models. Finally, demonstration of the versatility of the diff_predictor package showed we can classify regional differences in diffusion in the brain using a new different experimental dataset. The models produced by diff_predictor had accuracies up to 54.56% for prediction in age-based data, and accuracies up to 91.35% for prediction in regional-based data. Furthermore, SHAP values produced by the decision tree methods in diff_predictor provided useful information toward nanoparticle environment and interactions.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewedApril 5, 2021). 0aParticle dynamicsxMathematical models. 0aMachine learning.0 aMachine learning0 aMultiple Particle Tracking0 aNanoparticle0 aNanotherapeutics0 aPrediction0 aSHAP0 aChemical engineering 4aThesesxChemical engineering. 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aNance, Elizabeth,d1985-edegree supervisor.40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/46394  aWAUW05213cam a2200517 i 45000010011000000080041000110060019000520050017000710070014000880400044001021000032001462450153001782640063003312640011003943000072004053360026004773370026005033380036005293470021005653470008005865000010005945020044006045040057006485203269007055880093039746500028040676500023040956500023041186500022041416500049041636500049042126500054042616500048043156530025043636530021043886530029044096530014044386530018044526530019044706550034044896550047045236550028045707000051045988560037046490490009046861154647967200518t20202020waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20200716184306.1cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdWAUdOCLCFdOCL1 aStoddard, Ryan J.,eauthor.10aDevelopment of stable, high optoelectronic quality perovskites using photoluminescence, photoconductivity, and machine learning /cRyan J.

Reducing the cost of photovoltaics can be attained by improving power conversion efficiency, increasing module lifetime, and reducing processing and CAPEX costs. However, mature technologies such as silicon are presently approaching fundamental efficiency limits, and cost reductions have plateaued. Hybrid Perovskites (HPs) are an emerging material class that show promise since they are inexpensive to fabricate via solution processing, and they have broadly tunable material properties. The HP bandgap can be precisely tuned to pair with silicon in a tandem solar cell, increasing the theoretical power conversion efficiency limit with minimal additional processing costs. The work presented in this dissertation is broadly focused on improving the performance and reliability of perovskite materials for photovoltaic applications. First, I demonstrate a photoluminescence-photoconductivity (PL-PC) technique that directly measures HP quasi-Fermi level splitting ([Delta]E[subscript]F) and carrier diffusion length (L[subscript]D), which are predictors of device open-circuit voltage and short-circuit current respectively. I use this PC-PL technique to highlight several cases where [Delta]E[subscript]F and L[subscript]D are anti-correlated and show the importance of quantifying L[subscript]D in determining overall absorber optoelectronic quality. Next, I focus on development of high-bandgap HPs for tandem applications. Although halide mixing can increase the bandgap to make an ideal bandgap pairing with silicon in tandem applications, the mixed-halide HPs suffer from lower relative voltages and phase instabilities under illumination. Using high-throughput combinatorial exploration, I identified a new compositional motif using larger guanidinium and smaller cesium to form a stable HP structure with enhanced lattice strain. This class of mixed-halide HPs with enhanced strain show modified band structure, higher film [Delta]E[subscript]F, and device open-circuit voltage. I expanded the combinatorial exploration of HP compositions and collect a dataset of 13,000 photoluminescence (PL) spectra indexed by composition. Additionally, I show a proof of concept of using a machine learning approach to predict material bandgap and optoelectronic quality fraction. I also study the origin and impact of phase segregation in mixed-halide HPs and discover phase segregation occurs due to excess charge carriers, which can be generated either by photoexcitation or by current injection. Finally, I study degradation of HP films and devices in various combinations of light, atmosphere, humidity, and thermal stresses and use a machine learning model to link early time behavior to the time it takes the material or device to degrade. This effort reveals simple optical measurements such as transmittance and dark field microscopy have considerable utility in identifying early signs of HP degradation. Collectively, the work included in this dissertation demonstrates considerable progress toward understanding optoelectronic performance and reliability of a wide class of HP materials, with focus on high-bandgap HPs useful for tandem applications.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed May 18, 2020). 0aPerovskite solar cells. 0aPhotoluminescence. 0aPhotoconductivity. 0aMachine learning. 7aPhotoluminescence.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01062036 7aPhotoconductivity.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01061530 7aPerovskite solar cells.2fast0(OCoLC)fst02009247 7aMachine learning.2fast0(OCoLC)fst010047950 aChemical Engineering0 aMachine Learning0 aOptoelectronic Materials0 aPhotonics0 aPhotovoltaics0 aSemiconductors 4aThesesxChemical engineering. 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aHillhouse, Hugh W.,d1972-edegree supervisor.40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/45458  aWAUW05469cam a2200481 i 45000010011000000080041000110060019000520050017000710070014000880400058001021000035001602450150001952640063003452640011004083000087004193360026005063370026005323380036005583470021005943470008006155020044006235040057006675203657007245880094043816500028044756500016045036500022045196500042045416500054045836500048046376530012046856530011046976530015047086530021047236530025047446530019047696550034047886550047048226550028048697000044048978560037049410490009049781244817711210405t20202020waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20210714142900.2cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdOCLCOdOCLCFdWAUdOCLCOdOCL1 aTosado, Gabriella A.,eauthor.10aDevelopment of highly efficient and stable lead-free perovskite solar cells through composition and interface engineering /cGabriella A.

Hybrid organic-inorganic lead halide perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) have emerged in the past decade as a promising low-cost, low energy intensity, thin film solar cell with lab efficiencies reaching 25.2%. The toxicity of Pb perovskites and performance and stability issues with Sn lead-free alternatives remains a major roadblock to commercialization. In this work, novel perovskite compositions are designed and used to study the transition from Pb to Sn perovskites, cations are tuning to implement stabilizing components for pure Sn perovskites, and Sn perovskites performance and stability issues are tackled. The triple cation methylammonium (MA), formamidinium (FA) and Cs, with double halide composition Csx(MA₀.₁₇FA₀.₈₃)₁-xPb₁-ySny(I₀.₈₃Br₀.₁₇)₃ films with x = 0.05, 0.10, and 0.20 and y = 0, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, and 1.0 was used to create a library of new perovskites and study novel band gap trends near the maximum Schockley Quiesser limit. The simple inverted device structure of indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly (3,4, -ethylenedioxythiphene): polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS)/Perovskite/[6,6]-phenyl-C60-butyric acid methyl ester (PC₆₀BM)/fullerene (C₆₀)/2,9-dimethyl-7,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline (BCP)/Ag eliminated dopant instabilities. Due to a high-quality film morphology and optimal bandgap, 3 3 Cs₀.₀₅(MA₀.₁₇FA₀.₈₃)₀.₉₅Pb₀.₂₅Sn₀.₇₅(I₀.₈₃Br₀.₁₇)₃ (band gap = 1.30 eV), achieved a record maximum efficiency of 11.05% for any 75% Sn composition. Moreover, the 75% Sn PVSCs retained 80% of initial PCE after 30 days storage in inert conditions and 100 hours in ambient conditions. After optimizing antisolvent choice, solvent annealing, and hot casting conditions for pure Sn perovskite films, the novel composition with Cs, FA, and guanidinium (GA), (CsGA)xFA₁₀₀ ₂xSnI₃ was implemented. This cation mixture combines the benefits of a guanidinium cation, such as increased hydrogen bonding and no dipole moment, with Cs to fill point defects and relax the crystal lattice to better integrate a large stabilizing agent, ethylenediammonium diiodide (EDAI₂). The EDAI₂ additive not only yielded pinhole-free cubic phase (CsGA)xFA₁₀₀-₂xSnI₃ perovskite films but also decreased both shallow and deep trap states in the perovskite films. The devices with (CsGA)₁₅FA₇₀SnI₃ and 0-2% EDAI₂ all achieved a maximum PCE higher than 5% with the highest of 5.72% for a fresh device with (CsGA)₁₅FA₇₀SnI₃ and 1% EDAI₂. After storage, the maximum PCE was increased from 5.69% to 6.39% for the (CsGA)₁₅FA₇₀SnI₃ and 1.5% EDAI₂ devices. Finally, to tackle energy loss issues that have plagued pure Sn perovskites (loss = 0.6-0.9 V), the misalignment between the PEDOT:PSS hole transport layer and the Sn perovskite valence band was studied due to the energy misalignment between the hole transport layer and pure Sn perovskite valence band. Cosolvent methods, solvent wash methods, and solvent immersion methods with DMSO, EG, and CH₃OH were implemented to alter the PSS content and work function of the HTL to improve alignment. Utilizing the (CsGA)₁₅FA₇₀SnI₃+1.0% EDAI₂ perovskite film we demonstrated a higher performance of 6.29% and 6.16% with a 5% DMSO cosolvent and methanol solvent wash, respectively. This work is a comprehensive push to improve the performance and stability of non-toxic Sn perovskite devices, bringing this technology one step closer to commercialization.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed April 5, 2021). 0aPerovskite solar cells. 0aTin alloys. 0aCesium compounds. 7aTin alloys.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01151292 7aPerovskite solar cells.2fast0(OCoLC)fst02009247 7aCesium compounds.2fast0(OCoLC)fst017453720 aDopants0 aHybrid0 aPerovskite0 aRenewable energy0 aChemical engineering0 aNanotechnology 4aThesesxChemical engineering. 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aYu, Qiuming,d1963-edegree supervisor.40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/46395  aWAUW04114cam a2200469 i 45000010011000000080041000110060019000520050017000710070014000880400063001021000029001652450092001942640063002862640011003493000071003603360026004313370026004573380036004833470021005193470008005405000010005485020044005585040056006025202353006585880099030116500021031106500026031316500038031576500047031956500052032426530020032946530013033146530025033276530025033526530025033776550034034026550046034366550028034827000088035108560037035980490009036351196339739200921t20202020waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20210721171952.1cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdOCLCFdWAUdOCLdOCLCOdWAUdOCLCO1 aTsao, Caroline,eauthor.10aZwitterionic polymer-based platforms for biotherapeutics and implants /cCaroline Tsao. 1a[Seattle] :b[University of Washington Libraries],c[2020] 4c©2020  a1 online resource (ix, 117 pages) :billustrations (chiefly color)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext file2rdaft  bPDF  aVita.  bPh.

Biotherapeutics offer great advantages of high specificity towards difficult diseases, yet biotherapeutics are often physiochemical unstable and immunogenic; implantable devices with multiple functionalities create effective solutions to medical situations, yet they often suffer from reduced longevity due to the foreign body reaction triggered. Many biomaterials have been developed to tackle these issues. However, few biomaterials have been transferred from benchtop to clinical treatments, and biocompatibility issues of biomaterials have started to draw concerns. Thus, the development of new biomaterials is essential for the realization of contemporary medical treatments. In this dissertation, we discuss the development of zwitterionic polymer-based platforms for peptide therapeutics, non-invasive drug delivery, and implants. We first investigate how zwitterionic polymers would enhance the performance of peptides therapeutics. The native glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) no longer suffers from rapid renal clearance and degradation after the conjugation of a zwitterionic polymer and provides glycemic control in mice for up to 6 days, demonstrating its potential as a diabetes treatment. We next develop a non-invasive pulmonary systemic delivery platform for large protein drugs. The zwitterionic polymers significantly improved the bioavailability of organophosphate hydrolase (OPH) and the prevention of organophosphate poisoning through the non-invasive delivery of the conjugated OPH shows significant potential for protecting our warfighters in threat of nerve agents. In addition, we also design high-strength, pure zwitterionic-elastomeric-networked (ZEN) hydrogels through the mechanisms of swellability and the locking effect. The ZEN hydrogels can be considered highly biocompatible as no fibrotic capsule was formed after one year of implantation, which showed great potential for implantable devices. In these studies, we explore and expand the capacity of using zwitterionic polymers for protein/peptide drug delivery and long-term implantation. The new findings could provide new solutions and advance the field of biotherapeutics development, non-invasive drug delivery system, and implantable devices.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed September 21, 2020). 0aPolyzwitterions. 0aBiomedical materials. 0aDrug delivery devicesxMaterials. 7aPolyzwitterions.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01739529 7aBiomedical materials.2fast0(OCoLC)fst008325860 aBiotherapeutics0 aImplants0 aPoly(carboxybetaine)0 aZwitterionic polymer0 aChemical engineering 4aThesesxChemical engineering. 7aAcademic theses2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aJiang, Shaoyi,d1964-edegree supervisor.1http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q8856592040uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/45883  aWAUW02929cam a2200541 i 45000010011000000080041000110060019000520050017000710070014000880400051001021000033001532450084001862640063002702640011003333000067003443360026004113370026004373380036004633470021004993470008005205020042005285040055005705200968006255880099015936500029016926500026017216500032017476500026017796500030018056500056018356500052018916500052019436500058019956530016020536530017020696530012020866530013020986530012021116530023021236530019021466530025021656550034021906550046022246550028022707000043022988560037023410490009023781196340155200921t20202020waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20210120172533.5cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdOCLCFdWAUdOCLdOCLCO1 aWu, Kun-Lin,d1993-eauthor.10aPharmacological regulation of protein-polymer hydrogel stiffness /cKun-Lin Wu. 1a[Seattle] :b[University of Washington Libraries],c[2020] 4c©2020  a1 online resource (ii, 22 pages) :billustrations (some color)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext file2rdaft  bPDF  bM.S.cUniversity of Washingtond2020.  aIncludes bibliographical references (pages 20-21).3 aThe extracellular matrix (ECM) exhibits constant physiochemical changes throughout all biological processes, including organ development, maintenance of tissue homeostasis, and disease progression/ healing.

However, the requirements of cell harvesting, in vitro expansion, cell seeding, maturation in bioreactors, and decellularization involved in traditional tissue engineering often make the time and costs for engineering tissues unaffordable to patients. As a result, there's currently no tissue engineered product that withstands the test of the market, hindering the delivery of the promise of regeneration to patients. In situ tissue engineering, by recruiting cells from the body directly to the site to be regenerated and using the body as the bioreactor, bypasses all the in vitro works, eliminating the time and costs associated with them. Thus such an approach is more likely to be translational. The research from the Ratner Lab has demonstrated that precision-engineered porous material with pore sizes in the range of 30-40 [micro]m maximizes the recruitment of macrophages which in turn orchestrate blood vessels and other tissues to integrate into the material. Here, we focus on in situ tissue engineered vascular grafts using such angiogenic and regenerative materials for the replacement of blood vessels. First, we developed a biostable elastic polymer (elastomer) with tunable mechanical property able to match that of the native blood vessels. Second, we demonstrated, in a mouse subcutaneous implant model, the precision-engineered elastomer eliminates the foreign body capsule (FBC) and maximizes the ingrowth of capillary blood vessels. Such effects are accompanied and potentially explained by the increase of macrophage recruitment and the decrease of inflammatory macrophages. Third, we manufactured the vascular graft by integrating the porous elastomer, a reinforcement fabric, and a sealant with tunable degradation rate. Fourth, we are conducted short-term implantation studies in both pig and sheep models. We hypothesize that, combining the pro-angiogenic effect, matching mechanical property, and reduction of FBC, our vascular graft will improve healing and reduce intimal hyperplasia (IH). Our first target for clinical application is to improve the performance of vascular grafts for hemodialysis access, which currently have a failure rate of 50% within the first year. If proven successful, such vascular graft can be easily applied to address to broad clinical problems of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) that are responsible for one in every three deaths. The strategy of co-optimizing porous structure, mechanical property, and bio-degradability is also being applied to developing skin grafts and grafts for regeneration after spinal cord injury (SCI).0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed May 18, 2020). 0aVascular grafts. 0aTissue engineering. 0aElastomers. 0aBiomedical materials. 7aVascular grafts.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01164501 7aTissue engineering.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01151484 7aElastomers.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00904231 7aBiomedical materials.2fast0(OCoLC)fst008325860 aForeign body reaction0 aHealing0 aImmunomudulation0 aSheep0 aTissue engineering0 aVascular graft0 aChemical engineering 4aThesesxChemical engineering. 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aRatner, B.

Novel materials such as conducting polymer and perovskite are developed to replace the traditional group III-V inorganic materials and counter the new challenges. Ultraviolet (UV) photodetectors play a critical role in scientific, commercial, civil, and military areas. Perovskite materials with tunable bandgap have been successfully applied to fabricate high-performance solar cells. However, their potential for UV detection has not been demonstrated yet. In this work, pinhole-free methylammonium lead trichloride (CH₃NH₃PbCl₃) perovskite thin films were fabricated via a two-step spin coating and solvent-vapor-assisted thermal annealing method under low temperature for the first time. Prototypical UV photodetectors based on CH₃NH₃PbCl₃ perovskite thin films were fabricated and showed strong photoresponse in the 300-400 nm region. All the results demonstrated that low-temperature solution-processed CH₃NH₃PbCl₃ perovskite thin films offer great potential for making flexible, lightweight visible-blind UV-A photodetectors. Narrowband UV photodetectors are highly desired in multiple areas. Photodetectors based on organic-inorganic nanocomposite offer high sensitivity, widely adjustable response range, lightweight, and low-temperature solution processibility. However, the broad absorption range of organic and inorganic semiconductor materials make it difficult to achieve a narrowband detection feature. Nanocomposite thin films containing the conjugated polymer poly[(9,9-dioctylfluorenyl-2,7-diyl)-alt-co-(bithiophene)] (F8T2) blended with ZnO nanoparticles (NPs) were applied as the active layers of the photodetectors. Narrowband UV photodetectors with high gain and low driving voltage were demonstrated by adopting a symmetric device structure, controlling the active layer composition and microstructure, and manipulating the light penetration depth in the active layer. Our method offers a pathway to design and fabricate narrowband UV photodetectors. Hybrid organic-inorganic perovskite has shown its potential as high-performance solar cell active layer. However, its instability, including intrinsic and operational instability, strongly hinders its real-life applications. Two types of methylammonium (MA)-free, formamidinium (FA)-based perovskite, Rb₀.₀₅Cs₀.₁FA₀.₈₅PbI₃ and Cs₀.₁₅FA₀.₈₅PbI₃, was fabricated and the effect of Rb⁺ on the device performance and long-term stability were investigated. By simply mixing the precursor solution before spin coating, the defect states in both types of perovskite were significantly reduced and device stabilities against the electric field were improved. The modified precursor solution provided devices with Rb₀.₀₅Cs₀.₁FA₀.₈₅PbI₃ and Cs₀.₁₅FA₀.₈₅PbI₃ active layer that retained 68% and 92% of their initial PCE, respectively, over 30 days under N₂ protection. The work sheds a light on the solution of the operational instability of perovskite solar cells and paves the pathway for their industrialization. To further improve the optoelectronic device performance based on poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) conducting polymer, a hydroxymethyl (-MeOH) and chloromethyl (-MeCl) function group was introduced to the oxyethylene ring of EDOT monomer. Oxidative chemical polymerization was applied to synthesize PEDOT:PSS and functionalized PEDOT:PSS. The polymerization mechanism of PEDOT:PSS and effects of functional group on the polymerization were revealed. The study sheds light on the polymerization of PEDOT with functional groups and provides a guideline for the synthesis of functionalized PEDOT conducting polymers with polyelectrolyte counterions using oxidative chemical polymerization.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed September 21, 2020). 0aOptoelectronic devices. 0aThin films. 0aPerovskite. 0aMethylaminesxDerivatives. 7aThin films.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01150018 7aPerovskite.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01058323 7aOptoelectronic devices.2fast0(OCoLC)fst010469080 aEngineering0 aChemical engineering 4aThesesxChemical engineering. 7aAcademic theses2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aYu, Qiuming,d1963-edegree supervisor.40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/45884  aWAUW04243cam a2200481Ii 45000010011000000080041000110060019000520050017000710070014000880400044001021000034001462450133001802640063003132640011003763000083003873360026004703370026004963380036005223470021005583470008005795000010005875020044005975040055006415202466006965880098031626500026032606500016032866500020033026500042033226500046033646500052034106530018034626530019034806530025034996530017035246530022035416550034035636550047035976550028036447000043036728560037037150490009037521128832580191125t20192019waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20200714225941.3cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdOCLCFdWAUdOCL1 aAdelmund, Steven M.,eauthor.10aSpatiotemporally resolved proteomics and dynamic biomaterial control through bioorthogonal photochemistry /cSteven M.

Though all cells within an organism share a common genome, differential expression of genes into proteins regulate developmental processes, tissue morphogenesis and function, disease susceptibility and response, and a wide variety of intra- and extra-cellular signaling events. This thesis introduces the first tools for spatiotemporally resolved proteomics, enabling visualization and quantification of proteins produced in vitro and in vivo within user-defined regions of time and 3D space (i.e., 4D). Light-activated bioorthogonal non-canonical amino acid tagging (laBONCAT) exploits the photouncaging of a reactive amino acid prior to translational incorporation, while photoactivated in vitro/vivo tagging (PAINT) utilizes light to spatially tag proteins that were previously metabolically labeled. In both cases, affinity purification and quantitative mass spectrometric analysis permits 4D mapping of global protein production within living samples. Relying on bioorthogonal photochemistries that can be performed on demand and with single-micron resolution, this work demonstrates the ability to label newly synthesized proteins in 2D/3D culture and in zebrafish models with subcellular resolution. This unique approach is likely to prove useful in determining new diagnostic markers for disease, as well as expanding our knowledge of fundamental biology. Recognizing the precise 4D control that photochemistry affords, this thesis further expands the toolbox of photochemical reactions available, creating biomaterials whose chemical and physical properties can be modulated in a wavelength-dependent manner. Here, a photoorthogonal reaction scheme is introduced that combines photocleavable linkers based on ortho-nitrobenzyl ester (oNB) and a boron-dipyrromethene (BODIPY) that respond to UV and visible light, respectively. oNB remains undisturbed under 505 nm irradiation, while BODIPY undergoes rapid photolysis. Although BODIPY also cleaves with 365 nm irradiation, its comparative slow degradation kinetics permit reaction orthogonality with oNB under physiological conditions. This pair permits on-demand and spatially defined regulation of protein presentation within and degradation of hydrogel biomaterials, providing exciting opportunities for controlled drug delivery and tissue engineering applications.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed November 25, 2019). 0aBiomedical materials. 0aProteomics. 0aPhotochemistry. 7aProteomics.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01079785 7aPhotochemistry.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01061514 7aBiomedical materials.2fast0(OCoLC)fst008325860 aBioorthogonal0 aPhotochemistry0 aChemical engineering0 aBiochemistry0 aOrganic chemistry 4aThesesxChemical engineering. 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aDeForest, Cole A.,edegree supervisor.40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/44744  aWAUW02339cam a2200481Ii 4500001001000000008004100010006001900051005001700070007001400087040007900101100002700180245009900207264006300306264001100369300005900380336002600439337002600465338003600491347002100527347000800548502004800556504005500604520052700659588009601186650002501282650005301307650003201360650001601392650004201408650005101450653001201501653002901513653001901542653001601561653001201577653002501589655003401614655004701648655002801695700008801723856003701811049000901848956509051160811t20162016waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20210721171419.5cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdOCLCOdOCLCFdWAUdOCLCAdOCLCQdOCLCOdWAUdOCLCO1 aAi, Jia-Ruey,eauthor.10aMixed-charge copolymer as environmentally friendly low fouling marine coatings /cJia-Ruey Ai. 1a[Seattle] :b[University of Washington Libraries],c[2016] 4c©2016  a1 online resource (v, 21 pages) :bcolor illustrations  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext file2rdaft  bPDF  bM.S.

In accommodating this demand for growth, we explore the possibility that the Car9 affinity tag, a silica-binding dodecamer, may provide an inexpensive alternative to the current gold-standard, the hexahistidine tag. Specifically, we show that the Car9 extension, which was previously shown to be functional as a C-terminal affinity tag, supports rapid purification when appended to the N-terminus of proteins, yielding a>85% purity in a manner of minutes. In addition, we demonstrate two novel methods of Car9 tag removal using the outer-membrane protease, OmpT. The first involves the use of OmpT-overproducing E. coli cells crosslinked to chitosan microspheres using glutaraldehyde. The second employs a mutated version of purified Ompt that is itself modified with a Car9 tag. We show that the immobilized cells support complete excision of a C-terminal Car9 tag in 24h of incubation with no contaminant formation. These catalytic microspheres are reusable, storable, and show promise for larger scale experiments. An OmpT-Car9 fusion protein refolded from inclusion bodies was also shown to support Car9 tag cleavage, and removal with silica. However, further experimentation will be required to determine binding affinity of OmpT-Car9 for future purification and retrieval optimization experiments.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed August 11, 2016). 0aProteinsxPurification. 0aProteinsxAffinity labeling. 0aProteolytic enzymes. 0aMicrospheres. 7aMicrospheres.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01020099 7aProteinsxAffinity labeling.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01079713 7aProteinsxPurification.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01079750 7aProteolytic enzymes.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01079783  aAffinity Tag  aCar9  aChitosan  aMicrospheres  aOmpT  aSilica  aChemical engineering 4aThesesxChemical engineering. 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aBaneyx, François,edegree supervisor.40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/36521  aWAUW02871cam a2200505Ii 45000010011000000080041000110060019000520050017000710070014000880400065001021000030001672450114001972640063003112640011003743000060003853360026004453370026004713380036004973470021005333470008005545020048005625040055006105200991006655880093016566500046017496500046017956500022018416500072018636500048019356530020019836530016020036530019020196530021020386530009020596530020020686530021020886530024021096530025021336550033021586550047021916550028022387000053022668560037023190490009023561043359957180706t20182018waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20190504103329.9cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdOCLCOdOCLCFdWAUdOCLdOCLCQdOCLCO1 aAvadhoot, Rahul,eauthor.10aPyMolSAR :ba Python-based toolkit to predict the activity and property of small molecules /cRahul Avadhoot. 1a[Seattle] :b[University of Washington Libraries],c[2018] 4c©2018  a1 online resource (ii, 27 pages) :bcolor illustrations  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext file2rdaft  bPDF  bM.S.

However, building such models in Python is cumbersome for cheminformatics researchers as they must use several Python packages and undertake a sequence of modeling steps. For instance, use Python packages for calculating molecular descriptors and generating models. Therefore, a Python toolkit that integrates these Python packages and modeling steps will immensely benefit cheminformatics researchers. This work presents a Python toolkit, called PyMolSAR for building predictive structure-activity relationships models for small molecules. The functionality of PyMolSAR includes calculating 759 1D/2D molecular descriptors, data preprocessing, feature selection, training and evaluating predictive models.

Typical approaches, including systemic therapeutic administration and surgery, lack the precision required to effectively treat certain diseases. Biomaterials that dynamically sense and respond to critical aspects of their environment could enable new possibilities in targeted drug delivery, diagnostics, cell culture and regenerative medicine. However, there is not yet a framework for creating materials responsive to multiple inputs in a well-defined manner. This dissertation details the development of a modular biomaterial platform that can integrate multiple biochemical inputs to provide a functional output through Boolean computation. The connectivity and architecture of multiple stimuli-labile groups incorporated into a single linker determines its behavior upon the environmentally triggered cleavage of combinations of these moieties. To validate this framework we employed, light, reductant, and enzyme as inputs to create seventeen unique logically degradable hydrogels. The Boolean linkers were then used to govern the release of pendant proteins, small molecules, and therapeutics from non-degradable hydrogels. Finally, we exploited this system to enable logic-triggered activation of cell-penetrating peptides to regulate the cellular uptake of proteins.

This thesis summarizes the recent work in zwitterionic hydrogels. Firstly, zwitterionic hydrogel can repair itself independent of time after damage under physiological conditions due to a new mechanism, "zwitterionic fusion". In addition, we explored the properties of zwitterionic hydrogels in controlling the self-renewal and differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells. Finally, by developing a biodegradable zwitterionic hydrogel, we realized ex vivo expansion of mesenchymal stem cells and hematopoietic stem cells without differentiation.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed September 19, 2017). 0aPolyzwitterions. 0aBiomedical materials. 0aMesenchymal stem cellsxDifferentiation. 0aHematopoietic stem cells. 7aBiomedical materials.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00832586 7aHematopoietic stem cells.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00954931 7aMesenchymal stem cellsxDifferentiation.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01767960 7aPolyzwitterions.2fast0(OCoLC)fst017395290 aChemical engineering 4aThesesxChemical engineering 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aJiang, Shaoyi,d1964-edegree supervisor.1http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q8856592040uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/39977  aWAUW03894cam a2200541Ii 45000010011000000080041000110060019000520050017000710070014000880400044001021000033001462450097001792640063002762640011003393000066003503360026004163370026004423380036004683470021005043470008005255020044005335040055005775201894006325880098025266500021026246500024026456500030026696500036026996500050027356500062027856500047028476500056028946530018029506530021029686530021029896530023030106530022030336530026030556530022030816530028031036530025031316550034031566550047031906550028032377000041032658560037033060490009033431128832926191125t20192019waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20200714230024.9cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdOCLCFdWAUdOCL1 aBeckner, Wesley A.,eauthor.10aIonic liquid design using molecular simulation and statistical methods /cWesley A.

In the material domain presented in this work, ionic liquids (ILs), there are theoretically 1014-18 possible pairwise molecular structures-too many to synthesize exhaustively. For this particular design problem, we turn to computational approaches. But even here an exhaustive approach is intractable. A method of deciding what system to simulate in the first place must be optimized. There are many deterministic and stochastic algorithms available for such search spaces. The Darwinian processes of evolutionary algorithms (EAs), work by mutating a candidate solution until it attains a desired fitness. In this case, the fitness is determined by a quantitative structure property relationship (QSPR) usually in the form of a machine learning (ML) model. Because the ML model is based on learning examples, it pairs well with the search strategy of an EA-starting molecular configurations for the EA are based on the same examples that have informed the ML model. When a particular solution deviates far from the training data (i.e. its molecular structure is different than the structures of the molecules in the training data) the uncertainty estimate in its property prediction is high. When this occurs, the EA solution can be simulated in MD to either: a) explore the structure landscape and inform/update the model or b) exploit the structure landscape because the prediction is close to our target. The holy grail, however, of any material design process is to operate on smooth featural or structural surfaces, and therefore be able to calculate explicit gradients to iterate toward the target property in question. Such a design process is explored through the generative capabilities of a class of stochastic neural networks-variational autoencoders-for the explicit rationalization of desired IL thermodynamic properties.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed November 25, 2019). 0aIonic solutions. 0aSimulation methods. 0aEvolutionary computation. 0aMaterialsxMathematical models. 7aSimulation methods.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01119166 7aMaterialsxMathematical models.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01011852 7aIonic solutions.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00978618 7aEvolutionary computation.2fast0(OCoLC)fst009173380 aIonic liquids0 aMachine learning0 aMolecular design0 aMolecular dynamics0 aSearch algorithms0 aStatistical mechanics0 aMaterials Science0 aComputational chemistry0 aChemical engineering 4aThesesxChemical engineering. 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aPfaendtner, Jim,edegree supervisor.40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/44742  aWAUW04016cam a2200505Ii 4500001001000000008004100010006001900051005001700070007001400087040006000101100003600161245017000197264006300367264001100430300006200441336002600503337002600529338003600555347002400591502004800615504005500663520207700718588009602795650002102891650002202912650002002934650002402954650004702978650004603025650004803071650005003119653001403169653001603183653001503199653002303214653002503237653002603262653002303288655003403311655004703345655002803392700004403420856003703464049000903501956508277160811t20162016waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20190619182451.8cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdOCLCOdOCLCFdWAUdOCLCQdOCLCO1 aBlanchfield, Julie E.,eauthor.10aCharacterization and degradation of fatty acid methyl esters and biodiesel in artificial seawater under UV exposure using Raman spectroscopy /cJulie E.

Most of the world's commodities are shipped over the oceans by large cargo vessels and the carriage of potentially hazardous cargo has safety and environmental risks. The carriage of biofuels is becoming more commonplace and an environmental discharge of such fuels is a potential given international allowances for cargo tank cleaning. The fate of biodiesel in the marine environment is a newer focus of research as the industry expands. This research characterizes the vibrational modes of the building blocks of biodiesel (fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs)) and a commercial biodiesel sample through Raman spectroscopy. The concentration sensitivity of the Raman spectroscope in concentrations of ultra-pure and artificial seawater was found to be low; concentrations of 20% oil in water were necessary for good spectral resolution. Commercial biodiesel in artificial seawater was exposed under a UV lamp for 23 days to evaluate the degradation mechanisms. Isomerization was evidenced by the decline of the cis configurational vibration modes of the =CH bends. Photo-oxidation was apparent as the samples' double bonds broke down over time. It was shown from comparison with a lab-made FAME mix that the antioxidants in commercial biodiesel slowed this process considerably. Hydrolysis occurred breaking down the biodiesel's FAMEs into their relative free fatty acid and methanol. Methanol evaporated significantly from the sample; its presence was not measured directly through Raman spectroscopy but through a literature review and evaluation of vapor pressures, it was shown that methanol formed. The toxicity of methanol is a concern to marine organisms; however if most of the methanol formed through this degradation evaporates and exists the marine environment through natural physical oceanographic and transport processes, it is unlikely that biodiesel residue into the ocean will cause measurable harm to aquatic organisms.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed August 11, 2016). 0aBiodiesel fuels. 0aPhotodegradation. 0aPhotochemistry. 0aRaman spectroscopy. 7aBiodiesel fuels.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00832010 7aPhotochemistry.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01061514 7aPhotodegradation.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01742442 7aRaman spectroscopy.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01089674  aBiodiesel  aDegradation  aPhotolysis  aRaman spectroscopy  aChemical engineering  aChemical oceanography  aAlternative energy 4aThesesxChemical engineering. 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aYu, Qiuming,d1963-edegree supervisor.40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/36524  aWAUW05996cam a2200529Ii 4500001001000000008004100010006001900051005001700070007001400087040005300101100003200154245012000186246012400306264006300430264001100493300006200504336002600566337002600592338003600618347001900654347000800673502004300681504005700724520394600781588009804727650003004825650003504855650002404890650002204914650005004936650004804986650005605034653001605090653002105106653002905127653001805156653002105174653001805195653002505213653002705238655003405265655004705299655002805346700004605374856003705420049000905457964633570161130t20162016waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20190717165604.3cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdOCLCFdWAUdOCLCQdOCLCO1 aBorysiak, Mark D.,eauthor.10aPoint-­of-­care nucleic acid diagnostics using isotachophoresis and isothermal amplification /cMark D.

NAAT offer high diagnostic sensitivity and specificity that lead to confident diagnoses, as well as relatively fast results and diverse functionality (e.g. quantification, multiplexing). Despite the advantages of nucleic acid amplification tests, they currently have limited point-of-care (POC) utility due to the need for multi-step procedures and complex instruments that require skilled personnel and well-equipped laboratories. In this thesis, we aim to create integrated nucleic acid amplification technologies that are better suited for POC applications by developing devices that integrate unique sample preparation and amplification techniques. Specifically, we use a powerful electrokinetic method called isotachophoresis (ITP) to rapidly extract and concentrate nucleic acids using two buffers and an electric field. We also replace traditional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification with isothermal amplification methods that do not require thermocycling equipment. We present two devices that use isotachophoresis and isothermal amplification to extract and amplify nucleic acids from complex samples. The first technology is named the NAIL device--Nucleic acid Amplification using Isotachophoresis and Loop-mediated isothermal amplification. NAIL uses ITP and loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) to extract and amplify nucleic acids from complex matrices in less than one hour inside of an integrated chip. Fluid actuation is performed by passive capillary barriers and heated air chambers that act as valves and pumps respectively. LAMP amplifies nucleic acids at constant temperature and produces a bright fluorescent signal that can be detected using a mobile phone camera equipped with fluorescent filters. We show the limit of detection (LoD) of pathogenic E. coli O157:H7 cells from whole milk samples to be 1000 CFU/mL, which is a two orders of magnitude improvement to standard tube-LAMP reactions with diluted milk samples. The second device is called ITP-RPA, which combines isotachophoresis with the isothermal amplification strategy, recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA). This device offers improvements over NAIL because it simultaneously incorporates sample extraction with amplification, removing the need for any pumps, valves, etc. ITP-RPA offers detection of nucleic acids in less than 15-20 minutes, and uses low-cost glass fiber substrates that make it amenable to POC applications. We show the detection of nucleic acids spiked into serum and whole blood as we work towards creating a POC viral load monitoring diagnostic for HIV-1 antiretroviral therapy treatments. We discuss the design of ITP chemistry that can incorporate the reagents required for RPA, as well as how to adapt this chemistry for separating the reaction from sample inhibitors. We show the current LOD of the device to be 10,000 copies/mL in serum, which is one order of magnitude higher than the clinical threshold. Future work will aim to improve this value below the relevant threshold. The introduction to these thesis discusses diagnostic devices with a focus on nucleic acid diagnostics. It also presents the descriptions and relevant principles for ITP and isothermal amplification. Chapter 2 reviews and summarizes relevant metrics for developing diagnostic devices in the laboratory, as well as transitioning these devices to the clinic. Appreciating and using these metrics will benefit test developers by providing consistent measures to evaluate analytical and clinical assay performance, as well as guide the design of tests that will most benefit clinicians and patients. Discussion topics include analytical laboratory statistics, diagnostic sensitivity/specificity and clinical thresholds, clinical metrics, and case studies from relevant commercially available tests.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed November 30, 2016). 0aNucleic acidsxSynthesis. 0aNucleic acidsxDiagnostic use. 0aGene amplification. 0aIsotachophoresis. 7aGene amplification.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00939610 7aIsotachophoresis.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00980217 7aNucleic acidsxSynthesis.2fast0(OCoLC)fst010410840 aDiagnostics0 aIsotachophoresis0 aIsothermal Amplification0 aNucleic Acids0 aPaper substrates0 aPoint-of-care0 aChemical engineering0 aBiomedical engineering 4aThesesxChemical engineering. 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aPosner, Jonathan Dov,edegree supervisor.40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/37050  aWAUW03560cam a2200469Ii 45000010011000000080041000110060019000520050017000710070014000880400044001021000028001462450131001742640063003052640011003683000071003793360026004503370026004763380036005023470021005383470008005595000010005675020044005775040041006215201823006625880097024856500035025826500023026176500016026406500061026566500049027176500042027666530022028086530018028306530025028486530011028736550028028846550034029126550047029467000051029938560037030440490009030811083644030190130t20182018waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20190731191923.8cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdOCLCFdWAUdOCL1 aBraly, Ian L.,eauthor.10aOptoelectronic quality and stability of hybrid perovskites determined by steady-state luminescence techniques /cIan L.

In particular, inorganic-organic lead halide perovskites are well suited for converting the sun's rays into electrical power. In addition to having the right light-absorbing and charge-carrier transport properties, hybrid perovskites may be synthesized via facile solution-based deposition techniques and demonstrate notably low amounts of heat-generating losses under illumination. Even polycrystalline films cast from hand-made inks can sustain very high concentrations of light-generated charge carriers, and in turn sustain large open-circuit voltages. Further, the three-component formula of ABX3 (A = monovalent cation, B = divalent metal, C = halide) makes the composition space for hybrid perovskites enormous. Each component can be alloyed to tune the bandgap for either single-junction or two-junction applications. In this dissertation, several methods centered around steady-state photoluminescence are detailed for characterizing this new class of materials. We explore the impact of composition, illumination time, charge-injection, and atmospheric conditions on the optoelectronic quality and stability of hybrid perovskites. We show that absolute intensity steady-state photoluminescence measurements of neat hybrid perovskite thin-films modeled with the Lasher-Stern-Würfel equation enables reliable prediction of device open-circuit voltages. Combinatorial spray coating and photoluminescence mapping of halide alloys reveals that the optoelectronic quality decreases with increasing bromide concentration. Finally, we present a scalable analysis tool-kit to analyze wide-field microscope videos of hybrid perovskite thin-film photoluminescence flickering.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed January 30, 2019). 0aPhotovoltaic cellsxMaterials. 0aPhotoluminescence. 0aPerovskite. 7aPhotovoltaic cellsxMaterials.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01062160 7aPhotoluminescence.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01062036 7aPerovskite.2fast0(OCoLC)fst010583230 aPhotoluminescence0 aPhotovoltaics0 aChemical engineering0 aEnergy 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft 4aThesesxChemical engineering. 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst017264531 aHillhouse, Hugh W.,d1972-edegree supervisor.40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/42994  aWAUW04211cam a2200445Ii 4500001001000000008004100010006001900051005001700070007001400087040006700101100003100168245012300199264006300322264001100385300006300396336002600459337002600485338003600511347002400547500001000571502004300581504005700624520257000681588009603251650002003347650004603367653001203413653002503425653003203450653002203482653002303504653001303527653002503540655003403565655004703599655002803646700004503674856003703719049000903756956508273160811t20162016waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20190619182532.7cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdOCLCOdOCLCFdWAUdOCLCAdOCLCQdOCLCO1 aBraun, Trevor M.,eauthor.10aRemote control electrodeposition :bpatterning on substrates without direct electrical connections /cTrevor M.

Wiring to a substrate is especially difficult for micro/nano-manufactured systems or complex three-dimensional geometries. Bipolar electrochemistry involves spatially segregated, equal and opposite reduction and oxidation on an electrically floating substrate. We show that spatial and temporal control of bipolar electrochemical couples enables patterned electrodeposition (or etching) by "remote control" without wiring to the substrate. The driving force for bipolar electrochemistry is the potential variation in solution when a current is passed; solution potential variation creates regions of differing electrochemical behavior (oxidation or reduction) on a single conducting substrate. Bipolar electrochemistry has intricate mating between the thermodynamics of the bipolar electrochemical reactions, their charge transfer kinetics, and ionic migration through the electrochemical cell. We characterize local bipolar electrodeposition beneath the tip of a rastering microjet anode configuration we call a scanning bipolar cell (SBC). The fundamental interactions of thermodynamics, kinetics, and transport in the SBC are first explored using local cupric ion and nickel ion reduction to metal beneath the microjet, with concomitant oxidation of the copper substrate as the bipolar counter reaction. The bipolar current efficiency (BCE, the fraction of the applied current that flows through the unwired substrate) can be near unity under certain electrolyte and operating conditions. Advanced electrolyte design enables a wide variety of local electrodeposition chemistries (Ni, Cu, Au, and Ag) on an inert gold substrate; the bipolar counter reaction (ascorbic acid or ferrous ion oxidation) involves a far-field oxidation that leaves the gold substrate unchanged. Simple linearized scaling arguments capture the relationship between tool and electrolyte traits, enabling a 10X improvement in spatial resolution, down to the motion control limit of our device. But, scaling arguments over-predict the BCE compared to experimental values. Electroanalytical measurements of the bipolar electrolytes provide fundamental data that underpins more sophisticated simulations. Finite element method computations are used to explain where simple scaling relationships breakdown. The impact of local bipolar electrodeposition in printed circuit board repair, additive manufacturing, and electroanalytical research is discussed.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed August 11, 2016). 0aElectroplating. 7aElectroplating.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00907715  aBipolar  aCurrent Distribution  aElectrochemical Engineering  aElectrodeposition  aElectrolyte Design  aScanning  aChemical engineering 4aThesesxChemical engineering. 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aSchwartz, Daniel T.,edegree supervisor.40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/36525  aWAUW04574cam a2200445Ii 45000010011000000080041000110060019000520050017000710070014000880400065001021000042001672450098002092640063003072640011003703000063003813360026004443370026004703380036004963470021005323470008005535020043005615040041006045202937006455880092035826500051036746500077037256530013038026530015038156530015038306530018038456530018038636530025038816530022039066550033039286550047039616550028040087000046040368560037040820490009041191033544303180501t20172017waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20190501211242.0cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdOCLCOdOCLCFdWAUdOCLdOCLCQdOCLCO1 aCaldwell, Kyle Bernd,d1988-eauthor.10aAdhesion and interphase properties of reinforced polymeric composites /cKyle Bernd Caldwell. 1a[Seattle] :b[University of Washington Libraries],c[2017] 4c©2017  a1 online resource (xvii, 113 pages) :bcolor illustrations  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext file2rdaft  bPDF  bPh.

Fiber reinforced polymeric composites, in particular, possess impressive mechanical properties at a fraction of the weight of many other building materials. There will always, however, be a demand for producing lighter, stiffer, and stronger materials. Understanding the mechanism of adhesion and ways to engineer the reinforcement-matrix interphase can lead to the development of new materials with improved mechanical properties, and even impart additional functionality such as electrical conductivity. The performance of reinforced polymeric composites is critically dependent upon the adhesion between the reinforcement and the surrounding polymer. The relative adhesion between a filler and a thermoplastic matrix can be predicted using calculable thermodynamic quantities such as the Gibbs free energy of mixing. A recent model, COSMO-SAC, is capable of predicting the adhesion between organo-silane treated glass surfaces and several thermoplastic materials. COSMO-SAC uses information based on the charge distribution of a molecule's surface to calculate many thermodynamic properties. Density functional theory calculations, which are relative inexpensive computations, generate the information necessary to perform the COSMO-SAC analysis and can be performed on any given molecule. The flexibility of the COSMO-SAC model is one of the main advantages it possesses over other methods for calculating thermodynamic quantities. In many cases the adhesion between a reinforcing fiber and the surrounding matrix may be improved by incorporating interphase modifiers in the vicinity of the fiber surface. The modifiers can improve the fracture toughness and modulus of the interphase, which may improve the stress transfer from the matrix to the fiber. In addition, the interphase modifiers may improve the mechanical interlock between the fiber surface and the bulk polymer, leading to improved adhesion. In recent years, the use of so called "migrating agents" have been used to self-assemble nanoparticle reinforced fiber-matrix interphases in thermosetting resin systems. The inclusion of a modest amount of thermoplastic migrating agent can lead to the formation of a self-assembled interphase, without causing aggregation of nanoparticles in the bulk phase. Formulations containing excess migrating agent, however, can induce aggregation in the bulk of increasing severity with increasing migrating agent concentration. Several techniques were used to study the mechanism by which the migrating agents operate including, scanning electron microscopy, and in situ fluorescence microscopy. The self-assembly mechanism by which migrating agents operate is described well by depletion forces, which are depend on the geometry of the approaching objects, as well as the migrating agent molecular weight and concentration.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed May 1, 2018). 0aPolymeric compositesxDesign and construction. 7aPolymeric compositesxDesign and construction.2fast0(OCoLC)fst010705600 aAdhesion0 aComposites0 aInterphase0 aNanoparticles0 aSelf-assembly0 aChemical engineering0 aMaterials Science 4aThesesxChemical engineering 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aBerg, John C.,d1937-edegree supervisor.40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/40856  aWAUW02452cam a2200469Ii 4500001001000000008004100010006001900051005001700070007001400087040007900101100002600180245007600206264006300282264001100345300003300356336002600389337002600415338003600441347002400477502004100501504005500542520053100597588009601128650002501224650003601249650004401285650002101329650003201350650007001382650006201452650005801514650005101572650004701623653002501670655003401695655004701729655002801776700008801804700004401892856003701936049000901973956508187160811t20162016waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20210721171422.1cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdOCLCOdOCLCFdWAUdOCLCAdOCLCQdOCLCOdWAUdOCLCO1 aChe, Xinran,eauthor.10aBioinspired anti-fouling coating on hydrophobic surfaces /cXinran Che. 1a[Seattle] :b[University of Washington Libraries],c[2016] 4c©2016  a1 online resource (37 pages)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext filebPDF2rda  bM.S.cUniversity of Washingtond2016  aIncludes bibliographical references (pages 35-37).3 aAnti-biofouling is very important in many applications ranging from marine coatings to biomedical devices.

Moderate to severe HIE is the major cause of morbidity and mortality in neonates around the time of birth. Current experimental evidence and clinical trials suggest that therapeutic hypothermia (TH) can reduce brain damage and improve neurological outcomes after neonatal hypoxic-ischemic (HI) injury. However, some infants still die and nearly half of affected infants continue to have significant brain injury in spite of treatment with TH. Therefore, additional treatment options should be explored. Curcumin has recently been found to have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects that may mitigate the outcomes of brain injury after perinatal asphyxia. Nonetheless, curcumin has low solubility and limited ability to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Several studies show that nanoparticles have the ability to cross the BBB, and incorporation of curcumin into a nanoparticle platform can overcome therapeutic limitations for effective use. After crossing the BBB, nanoparticles must have the ability to travel through the brain parenchyma to reach diseased cells and deliver a therapeutic. Previously it has been found that poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)-coated polystyrene particle less than 114 nm in diameter with a zeta ([zeta])-potential more neutral than -6 mV can penetrate within the brain parenchyma. Using this criteria, the biodegradable polymer methoxy(polyethylene glycol)-poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (mPEG-PLGA) was used to prepare curcumin-loaded nanoparticles. The impact of nanoparticle formulation parameters on nanoparticle' size and [zeta]-potential was investigated. Curcumin loading and curcumin release kinetics from the nanoparticle were also studied. In addition, nanoparticle transport behavior in a rat brain ex vivo model was studied using a high resolution multiple particle tracking technique. The brain localization and biodistribution of the nanoparticle and preliminary efficacy study of the curcumin-loaded nanoparticle was studied in a postnatal day 7 (P7) HI rat model. It was found that the nanoprecipitation method is a feasible method to formulate both curcumin-loaded mPEG5k-PLGA45k (50:50) and PLGA45k (50:50) nanoparticles with 5 - 6% curcumin loading. mPEG5k-PLGA45k (50:50) surface-coated with 1% F127 had better mobility within the brain parenchyma than PLGA45k (50:50) and both nanoparticles had good stability and sustained curcumin release within 24 hours. Preliminary results also showed that mPEG5k-PLGA45k (50:50) was able to get into the brain and curcumin-loaded mPEG5k-PLGA45k (50:50) increased curcumin passage across the BBB and reduced neuronal injury in the HIE rat model. 0aCurcuminxTherapeutic usexControlled release. 0aPolymeric drug delivery systems. 0aNanoparticles. 0aHypoxic-ischemic encephalopathyxChemotherapy. 7aNanoparticles.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01032624 7aPolymeric drug delivery systems.2fast0(OCoLC)fst010705740 aCurcumin0 aDrug delivery0 aHypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy0 aNanoparticle0 aChemical engineering 4aThesesxChemical engineering 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aNance, Elizabeth,d1985-edegree supervisor.40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/39976  aWAUW04023cam a2200577Ii 45000010011000000080041000110060019000520050017000710070014000880400044001021000033001462450109001792640063002882640011003513000072003623360026004343370026004603380036004863470021005223470008005435020044005515040056005955201857006515880098025086500035026066500023026416500021026646500022026856500034027076500015027416500018027566500047027746500049028216500061028706500044029316500060029756500048030356500041030836530009031246530021031336530031031546530018031856530011032036530025032146550034032396550047032736550028033207000051033488560037033990490009034361117715429190909t20192019waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20200130213210.1cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdOCLCFdWAUdOCL1 aClark, James Allan,eauthor.10aEarth-abundant thin-film devices for photovoltaic and electrochemical applications /cJames Allan Clark. 1a[Seattle] :b[University of Washington Libraries],c[2019] 4c©2019  a1 online resource (xiv, 106 pages) :billustrations (chiefly color)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext file2rdaft  bPDF  bPh.

This thesis focuses on the technological development of devices which address two of these 21st-century challenges: global climate change and increasing pharmaceutical contamination of water supplies. Solution-processed Cu2ZnSnSe4 (CZTS) photovoltaic (PV) devices are a promising technology for next-generation PV devices because of their earth-abundant constituents and ability to be scaled up with roll-to-roll processing. This work identifies critical processing parameters during CZTS solution deposition to prevent the formation of amorphous carbon nitride impurity phases which ruin device performance. Discovery of new complexation chemistries in CZTS solutions allowed for the stabilization of a wide range of metal chloride species via Lewis acid-base interactions. This facilitated a novel silver and germanium co-alloying strategy in CZTS which led to devices with record high performance metrics. Electrochemical oxidation is a promising technology to remediate pharmaceuticals in wastewaters, but current technologies lead to the inadvertent generation of ClO3-, ClO4-, and other toxic byproducts (TBPs) which are more hazardous than many pharmaceuticals. This work is the first to identify that the high nitrogen content in human urine (which contain the majority of excreted pharmaceuticals) suppress ClO3- and ClO4- formation by 3 orders of magnitude. A novel, inexpensive device scheme was developed to treat pharmaceutical-contaminated urine at the source of generation. This device consists of a series of divided electrochemical cells which control pH via H2 and O2 evolution, and sequence oxidation/reduction such that pharmaceuticals are oxidized while ClO3-, ClO4-, and other TBPs are reduced.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed September 9, 2019). 0aPhotovoltaic cellsxMaterials. 0aThin film devices. 0aUrinexAnalysis. 0aElectrochemistry. 0aOxidation-reduction reaction. 0aChlorates. 0aPerchlorates. 7aUrinexAnalysis.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01162975 7aThin film devices.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01150011 7aPhotovoltaic cellsxMaterials.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01062160 7aPerchlorates.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01057677 7aOxidation-reduction reaction.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01049564 7aElectrochemistry.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00906371 7aChlorates.2fast0(OCoLC)fst008580620 aCZTS0 aElectrochemistry0 aPharmaceutical Degradation0 aPhotovoltaics0 aEnergy0 aChemical engineering 4aThesesxChemical engineering. 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aHillhouse, Hugh W.,d1972-edegree supervisor.40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/44091  aWAUW03195cam a2200541Ii 45000010011000000080041000110060019000520050017000710070014000880400065001021000034001672450144002012640063003452640011004083000069004193360026004883370026005143380036005403470021005763470008005975020048006055040051006535201108007045880098018126500031019106500017019416500021019586500048019796500043020276500057020706500047021276500074021746530015022486530019022636530016022826530017022986530012023156530017023276530025023446530022023696530019023916550034024106550028024446550047024727000088025198560037026070490009026441076552857181129t20182018waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20210721171321.1cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdWAUdOCLCFdOCLCQdOCLCOdWAUdOCLCO1 aCorrigan, Trevor J.,eauthor.10aHunt for a genetically engineered, rationally designed, stealth peptide to prevent non-specific protein interactions /cTrevor J.

Two major strategies currently available to achieve this protective affect are (a) chemical conjugation and (b) genetic engineering. This study pursues the later approach. A major obstacle to the genetic engineering approach as identified by previous studies is related to expression yields which is unique to fusion proteins. For this study, Enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein (EGFP) was used as a model protein. The four amino acid chains (all 10kDa in length) were examined. They were fused to EGFP as a vehicle to study expression, purification, structure, and activity. The best candidate has the best expression yield and protein activity. The results of this study will be used as the starting point of ongoing research efforts aimed at increasing circulation time and decreasing the foreign body response for protective and therapeutic proteins; replacing PEGylation with these highly hydrated and bio-degradable peptides.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed November 29, 2018). 0aGreen fluorescent protein. 0aAmino acids. 0aPolyzwitterions. 0aProteinsxStructure-activity relationships. 7aAmino acids.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00807622 7aGreen fluorescent protein.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00947607 7aPolyzwitterions.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01739529 7aProteinsxStructure-activity relationships.2fast0(OCoLC)fst010797620 aAmino Acid0 aBio-degradable0 aNon-Fouling0 aNon-Specific0 aProtein0 aZwitterionic0 aChemical engineering0 aMolecular biology0 aBioengineering 4aThesesxChemical engineering. 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst017264531 aJiang, Shaoyi,d1964-edegree supervisor.1http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q8856592040uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/42232  aWAUW04225cam a2200541Ii 45000010011000000080041000110060019000520050017000710070014000880400065001021000032001672450094001992640063002932640011003563000062003673360026004293370026004553380036004813470021005173470008005385020043005465040057005895202286006465880094029326500030030266500023030566500024030796500012031036500056031156500049031716500038032206500050032586530012033086530012033206530012033326530035033446530017033796530019033966530022034156530019034376530025034566550033034816550047035146550028035617000048035898560037036370490009036741042088329180627t20172017waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20190506003247.0cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdOCLCFdOCLCOdWAUdOCLdOCLCQdOCLCO1 aCrane, Matthew J.,eauthor.10aLaser-induced heat and momentum transfer in nanostructure processing /cMatthew J.

Steps toward this goal have led to applications in medicine, chemistry, physics, and engineering. Among the many possible synthetic parameters, light with wavelengths close to nanomaterial's size plays an increasingly important role due to its ability to resonantly target nanomaterials and to create highly non-equilibrium environments to explore new chemistry. Here, we leveraged Mie theory, chemistry, and photothermal effects to drive phase transformations in carbon and to assemble nanomaterial heterostructures. In the first part of this work, we developed a bottom-up method to synthesize doped nanodiamond with defects defined by small molecules. To demonstrate this process, we synthesized carbon aerogels doped with small molecules and drove a phase transformation at high pressures with photothermal heating. Photoluminescence revealed that the small molecules doped into the carbon aerogel persisted as active color centers in the nanodiamond product. These results open the door for designer defects that are precisely controlled by the stereochemistry of the molecular dopant, rather than thermodynamics. In addition, microscopy studies of the doped nanodiamond also revealed the incorporation of noble gas pressure media, which were previously thought to act only as spectators, challenging the existing view of the high pressure community. By leveraging the rapid timescale of photothermal heating, we also synthesized a new form of carbon with a rhombohedral unit cell, belonging to the Pban space group. We have tentatively named the phase Pban-carbon. In the second part of this work, we used light in the form of an optical trap, to manipulate, align, and assemble nanomaterial building blocks into complex heterostructures. To expand the range of accessible nanomaterials, we conducted these experiments in organic solvents for the first time. The fivefold decrease in thermal conductivity in organic solvents compared to water led to a nonlinear increase in temperature. We measured these temperatures optically with ratiometric quantum dots and used them to solder germanium nanorods together with bismuth nanocrystals.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed June 27, 2018). 0aNanostructured materials. 0aMomentum transfer. 0aHeatxTransmission. 0aLasers. 7aNanostructured materials.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01032630 7aMomentum transfer.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01025018 7aLasers.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00992842 7aHeatxTransmission.2fast0(OCoLC)fst009538260 aAerogel0 aDefects0 aDiamond0 aHigh pressure high temperature0 aOptical trap0 aSupercapacitor0 aMaterials Science0 aNanotechnology0 aChemical engineering 4aThesesxChemical engineering 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aPauzauskie, Peter John,edegree supervisor.40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/41685  aWAUW04083cam a2200517Ii 45000010011000000080041000110060019000520050017000710070014000880400044001021000034001462450117001802640063002972640011003603000068003713360026004393370026004653380036004913470021005273470008005485020044005565040057006005202210006575880098028676500036029656500032030016500016030336500035030496500061030846500042031456530021031876530015032086530018032236530022032416530020032636530016032836530018032996530019033176530025033366550034033616550047033956550028034427000049034708560037035190490009035561128832851191125t20192019waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20200714230006.5cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdOCLCFdWAUdOCL1 aCurtis, Chad,d1990-eauthor.10aTrajectory features as surrogate measures of the nanoparticle-microenvironment interaction space /cChad Curtis. 1a[Seattle] :b[University of Washington Libraries],c[2019] 4c©2019  a1 online resource (xi, 150 pages) :billustrations (some color)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext file2rdaft  bPDF  bPh.

Despite some successes, including FDA approval of micelle and liposomal formulations for the delivery of strongly hydrophobic anticancer drugs, the translation of these technologies has slowed; in 1995, the ratio of animal studies to FDA-approved drugs was 19:1 and the ratio of animal studies to clinical studies was 7:1. Fifteen years later in 2010, the ratio of animal studies to FDA-approved drugs was 4000:1, and the ratio of animal studies to clinical studies was 120:1. There are many factors contributing to the slow in translation of nanotherapeutic technologies including bottlenecks in funding and the number of researchers trained in translational and clinical studies. But there are some upstream causes that need to be addressed prior to consideration of clinical trials. In this dissertation, I focus on two in particular: a limited knowledge of nanoparticle-environment interactions at the cell, tissue, and organ levels; and the slowness of existing screening tools to identify potentially successful nanoformulations. This dissertation presents a number of tools that can be used to inform systems-level models of drug-environment interactions and improve the screening of drug candidates. Using in vitro and ex vivo models we demonstrate that nanoparticle colloidal stability can be used as a screening tool for nanoparticle therapeutics to the brain. We also demonstrate the use of trajectory datasets collected via fluorescent microscopy and multiple particle tracking to distinguish nuanced aspects of the nanoparticle-microenvironment interaction space using neural networks, including protein adhesion and nanoparticle cell uptake. We apply similar methods to investigate the role of key nanoparticle features (surface functionality, PEG grafting density, PEG chain length) in determining in vitro and ex vivo transport behavior. This method of analysis highlights the potential of nanoparticles to be used both as pre-clinical diagnostic probes without the use of complex chemistries and to guide nanoparticle design for therapeutic interventions.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed November 25, 2019). 0aNanoparticlesxTherapeutic use. 0aDiffusionxData processing. 0aNanofluids. 0aParticle tracking velocimetry. 7aParticle tracking velocimetry.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01894897 7aNanofluids.2fast0(OCoLC)fst017425070 aMachine learning0 aMicroscopy0 aNanoparticles0 aParticle tracking0 aSystems biology0 aNanoscience0 aNeurosciences0 aNanotechnology0 aChemical engineering 4aThesesxChemical engineering. 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aNance, Elizabeth,d1985-edegree supervisor.40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/44740  aWAUW03643cam a2200493Ii 45000010011000000080041000110060019000520050017000710070014000880400044001021000032001462450097001782640063002752640011003383000072003493360026004213370026004473380036004733470021005093470008005305020044005385040057005825201856006395880098024956500048025936500048026416500039026896500065027286530012027936530017028056530012028226530021028346530013028556530019028686530025028876530023029126530011029356550034029466550047029806550028030277000048030558560037031030490009031401117715528190909t20192019waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20200115191702.5cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdOCLCFdWAUdOCL1 aDawson-Elli, Neal,eauthor.14aThe role of data science in numerical modeling of lithium ion batteries /cNeal Dawson-Elli. 1a[Seattle] :b[University of Washington Libraries],c[2019] 4c©2019  a1 online resource (vii, 134 pages) :billustrations (chiefly color)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext file2rdaft  bPDF  bPh.

As the energy demands of mobile devices increase, the performance of batteries must also improve to keep pace. One of the key elements in iterative battery design is the application of numerical models which can predict the properties of potential batteries at significantly reduced cost compared to cell development, enabling high-throughput screening of potential materials and geometries. These models can vary in complexity from simple empirical fits, through continuum-scale models, up to molecular dynamics simulations, which offer increased fidelity, but at an extremely high computational cost. In addition to first-principles models, data-driven models have become popular as the available computational resources and amount of available data have grown astronomically. These models use self-tuning algorithms which form highly accurate nonlinear mappings from inputs to outputs, providing excellent accuracy for relatively low computational cost at runtime. While traditional data-driven models can achieve impressive results given a large amount of data, the acquisition of data at the proper scale is expensive, does not generalize well to other use conditions or battery chemistries, and offers little guidance in the form of physical interpretability. In this work, combinations of physical models and data-driven models are utilized in order to provide highly accurate, flexible applications of the information contained within the first-principles models, while also significantly reducing computational cost at runtime. While design applications of equivalent techniques are conceivable, this work focuses on applications for the calibration of first-principles models for the purposes of improved control of existing electrochemical cells.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed September 9, 2019). 0aLithium ion batteriesxMathematical models. 0aLithium ion batteriesxComputer simulation. 0aNeural networks (Computer science) 7aNeural networks (Computer science)2fast0(OCoLC)fst010362600 aBattery0 aData science0 aLithium0 aMachine learning0 aModeling0 aNeural network0 aChemical engineering0 aAlternative energy0 aEnergy 4aThesesxChemical engineering. 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aSubramanian, Venkat R.,edegree supervisor.40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/44093  aWAUW02687cam a2200409Ii 45000010011000000080041000110060019000520050017000710070014000880400039001021000031001412450159001722640063003312640011003943000070004053360026004753370026005013380036005273470021005633470008005845020049005925040055006415201119006965880098018156500039019136530017019526530033019696530033020026530018020356530025020536550034020786550047021126550028021597000044021878560037022310490009022681117715721190909t20192019waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20191022202149.5cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdOCLCFdWAU1 aDong, Hao,d1994-eauthor.10aTuning work function and conductivity of methylhydroxyl functionalized PEDOT-MeOH:PSS as a hole transport material for perovskite solar cells /cHao Dong. 1a[Seattle] :b[University of Washington Libraries],c[2019] 4c©2019  a1 online resource (vi, 66 pages) :billustrations (chiefly color)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext file2rdaft  bPDF  bM.S.

By introducing a methylhydroxyl (-MeOH) function group to the oxyethylene ring of EDOT, it lowers the highest unoccupied molecular orbital of PEDOT-MeOH. In addition, the MeOH function group allows the formation of hydrogen bonds among EDOT-MeOH monomers and with sulfate groups on PSS, promoting the growth of long chain PEDOT-MeOH and enhancing the doping efficiency. The work function and conductivity of PEDOT-MeOH:PSS were tuned via varying the amount of PSS and ferric oxidizing agent used in the polymerization and further via adding ethylene glycol as the secondary doping. The optimized PEDOT-MeOH:PSS-based PVSCs overperformed the PEDOT-PSS-based PVSCs because of better aligned energy level and enhanced conductivity of PEDOT-MeOH:PSS. This work provides new insights on developing hole transport materials to enable efficient inverted p-i-n PVSCs.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed September 9, 2019). 0aPerovskite solar cellsxMaterials.0 aConductivity0 aEthylene glycol modification0 aMethylhydroxyl functionalize0 aWork function0 aChemical engineering 4aThesesxChemical engineering. 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aYu, Qiuming,d1963-edegree supervisor.40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/44098  aWAUW02957cam a2200517Ii 45000010011000000080041000110060019000520050017000710070014000880400065001021000041001672450116002082640063003242640011003873000056003983360026004543370026004803380036005063470021005423470008005635020041005715040055006125201039006675880093017066500022017996500031018216500021018526500010018736500019018836500047019026500045019496500057019946500036020516500048020876530016021356530020021516530026021716530025021976530019022226550033022416550047022746550028023217000044023498560037023930490009024301043360307180706t20182018waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20190504103321.2cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdOCLCOdOCLCFdWAUdOCLdOCLCQdOCLCO1 aDunakey, Sonja June Glaser,eauthor.10aSelective labeling of single-walled carbon nanotubes using solid binding proteins /cSonja June Glaser Dunakey. 1a[Seattle] :b[University of Washington Libraries],c[2018] 4c©2018  a1 online resource (34 pages) :bcolor illustrations  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext file2rdaft  bPDF  bM.S.cUniversity of Washingtond2018  aIncludes bibliographical references (pages 20-23).3 aRobust and simple strategies to noncovalently functionalize single walled carbon nanotubes (SWNT) are of considerable interest for building hybrid nanomaterials and biosensors.

Organic active materials offer a low-cost, flexible, solution-processable alternative to inorganic materials. Strong, sensitive photoresponse with wavelength selectivity and tunability is highly desired, and can be achieved through material selection, active layer manipulation, and plasmonic nanostructure incorporation. In this work, 3D-finite-difference time domain (FDTD) electromagnetic simulations, transfer-matrix method (TMM) optical simulations, and experimental approaches were integrated to understand the relationship between physical parameters, underlying device physics, and photoresponse mechanisms to develop organic UV photodetectors with strong, sensitive, tunable photoresponse. Conventional organic photodiodes with active layers composed of blends of wide bandgap polymers and fullerene derivatives or ZnO nanoparticles were used to achieve strong and narrowband UV photoresponse via the mechanisms of photomultiplication and charge collection narrowing (CCN). By reducing the content of [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) in a polymer poly(9,9-dioctylfluorene-alt-bithiophene) (F8T2) active layer, isolated PC71BM clusters were formed and trapped electrons near the device cathode, resulting in band bending and hole injection, thus enabling multiple holes to be collected per incident photon and achieving photomultiplication. A peak EQE of 5600%, under 360 nm illumination and -40 V bias, was achieved by devices utilizing a 100:4 w:w blend of F8T2:PC71BM. Devices with active layers composed of poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine] (PTAA) and ZnO nanoparticles had photoresponse that could be tuned from broad and photomultiplicative to spectrally narrowband by using thin and thick active layers, respectively, via the CNN mechanism. A single EQE peak at 424 nm with a full-width at half-maximum of just 12 nm was demonstrated when a thick active layer was used. UV photoresponse was further tuned and enhanced by incorporating Al plasmonic nanostructure arrays, either as a transparent bottom electrode or a top electrode in conventional UV photodetectors. Al nanohole arrays (Al-NHAs) were incorporated into UV photodetectors as transparent electrodes and the resulting photoresponse spectra varied from having two peaks under reverse bias to a distinct, single peak under forward bias. This novel bias-dependent photoresponse switching was enabled by plasmonic enhancements to the electric field in the active layer, which acted as an additional forward bias in Al-NHA-based devices. Plasmonic Al nanostructures were also incorporated into the top device electrode in the form of a nanohemisphere array (NHSA) to engage the mechanisms of light scattering and electric field enhancement, which improve the strength and speed of photoresponse. This work sheds light on the improvement of UV photodetection through active layer optimization and plasmonic nanostructure incorporation, and opens up avenues to develop sensitive, spectrally selective photodetectors to meet the expanding photodetection needs of modern technology.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed November 25, 2019). 0aPhotoconductivity. 0aOptical detectorsxMaterials. 0aNanostructured materials. 7aPhotoconductivity.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01061530 7aNanostructured materials.2fast0(OCoLC)fst010326300 aCharge collection narrowing0 aNanosphere lithography0 aOrganic photodetectors0 aPhotomultiplication0 aPlasmonic nanostructures0 aUltraviolet photodetectors0 aChemical engineering0 aOptics0 aNanotechnology 4aThesesxChemical engineering. 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aYu, Qiuming,d1963-edegree supervisor.40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/44743  aWAUW02945cam a2200385Ii 45000010011000000080041000110060019000520050017000710070014000880400058001021000026001602450128001862640063003142640011003773000070003883360026004583370026004843380036005103470021005463470008005675020048005755040055006235201437006785880097021156500048022126500023022606500049022836530025023326550033023576550047023906550028024377000048024658560037025130490009025501077480645181204t20182018waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20190713032650.0cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdOCLCFdWAUdOCLCQdOCLCOdOCL1 aFan, Mengdi,eauthor.10aReview of capacity fade models for lithium-ion batteries :beffect of mechanisms on numerical implementation /cMengdi Fan. 1a[Seattle] :b[University of Washington Libraries],c[2018] 4c©2018  a1 online resource (ii, 37 pages) :billustrations (chiefly color)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext file2rdaft  bPDF  bM.S.

However, capacity fade always occurs due to unwanted side reactions including electrolyte oxidation at the positive electrode, lithium deposition at the negative electrode, electrolyte decomposition processes, and the formation of the Solid-Electrolyte Interphase (SEI) layer. To simulate the capacity fade, different models have been proposed in the literature. In this work, we model the capacity fade by assuming the SEI layer formation to be the dominant mechanism. Even among SEI layer models, several different expressions have been used in many papers. In most cases, the solid particles are assumed to be spherical, and the intercalation process is modeled using Fick's law of diffusion in the radial direction. In this work, the SEI-forming side reaction based on the Single Particle Model (SPM) is studied. Three models are compared with different charging rates cycling study. For solving the solid-phase diffusion in the radial-dimension, many efficient mathematical algorithms of reformulation and simulation have been proposed in the past. We address how those different SEI layer growth expressions affect the numerical implementation stability. The partial differential equations of the SPM are discretized using the finite difference method in the radial direction and solved in time using the numerical method of lines approaches.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed December 4, 2018). 0aLithium ion batteriesxMathematical models. 0aElectric capacity. 7aElectric capacity.2fast0(OCoLC)fst009045250 aChemical engineering 4aThesesxChemical engineering 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aSubramanian, Venkat R.,edegree supervisor.40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/42227  aWAUW02531cam a2200373Ii 45000010011000000080041000110060019000520050017000710070014000880400044001021000033001462450122001792640063003012640011003643000067003753360026004423370026004683380036004943470021005303470008005515020044005595040057006035201067006605880093017276500045018206500071018656530025019366550034019616550047019956550028020427000041020708560037021110490009021481101196006190515t20192019waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20200115120101.9cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdOCLCFdWAUdOCL1 aFu, Christopher D.,eauthor.10aContributing to the development of the metadynamics methodology for studying chemical reactions /cChristopher D.

However, due to the inherent complexities of reacting systems (i.e., the number of species and mechanisms that can occur), obtaining a clear understanding of the various sub-processes that take place can be an arduous and near-impossible task experimentally. With perpetual advancements in hardware, algorithms, and theory, computational tools and methods (e.g., molecular dynamics simulations) are increasingly appealing to use to complement experiments and help drive research forward. Simulations, unfortunately, come with their own set of drawbacks. To paraphrase Hippocrates, time steps are short, simulations long, transitions fleeting, assumptions perilous, and judgment difficult. Herein, we improve upon existing methods, and develop novel ones, to help address these challenges and pave the way for these types of computational methods to be practical tools for resolving complex reacting systems.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed May 15, 2019). 0aChemical reactionsxComputer simulation. 7aChemical reactionsxComputer simulation.2fast0(OCoLC)fst008531780 aChemical engineering 4aThesesxChemical engineering. 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aPfaendtner, Jim,edegree supervisor.40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/43646  aWAUW05356cam a2200469Ii 4500001001000000008004100010006001900051005001700070007001400087040006500101100003200166245007600198264006300274264001100337300005600348336002600404337002600430338003600456347001900492347000800511502004300519504005500562520358000617588009504197650002604292650003504318650004504353650007104398650006104469650005204530653003204582653001504614653001704629653001804646653002504664655003304689655004704722655002804769700004304797856003704840049000904877981494113170405t20162016waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20190524184353.3cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdOCLCOdOCLCFdWAUdOCLdOCLCQdOCLCO1 aFu, Yanfen,d1986-eauthor.10aMetabolic flux analysis and metabolomics of methylotrophs /cYanfen Fu. 1a[Seattle] :b[University of Washington Libraries],c[2016] 4c©2016  a1 online resource (89 pages) :bcolor illustrations  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext file2rda  bPDF  bPh.

Methylobacterium extorquens AM1 is the best studied model organism for methylotrophs, and it uses the serine cycle for assimilation of C1 units. Methylomicrobium buryatense 5GB1 is a Type I methanotroph that uses the ribulose monophosphate (RuMP) pathway for assimilation, and it is also an industrially promising candidate for bio-conversion of methane into valuable chemicals. Metabolic flux analysis and metabolomics are two important approaches to investigate cell behavior at the level of metabolites and fluxes, which are integrative consequences of gene expression. These approaches will provide critical information for a rational strain design process in metabolic engineering iterations. In the first part of the thesis, the metabolic flux analysis approach was successfully applied to M. exorquens AM1 to investigate the metabolic network response to the trade-off between growth rate and biomass yield. Then the method was tailored to apply to M. buryatense 5GB1 for flux elucidation in core metabolism under methane growth to provide baseline information for better prediction of performance. At the end, the combined approaches were used to investigate the core metabolism of M. buryatense 5GB1 response to two substrates, methane and methanol. This work has resulted in major new insights into methylotrophic metabolism. For the serine cycle methylotroph, it was demonstrated that the C3/C4 interconversion reactions, previously thought to be side reactions of little relevance to core metabolism, are critical to the ultimate values of growth rate and yield. This new insight now provides targets for strain engineering towards either maximum growth rate, or maximum yield. For the RuMP cycle methanotroph, it was determined first, that contrary to decades of assumptions in the literature, the Type I methanotroph studied here operates a complete, oxidative TCA cycle. That finding changes the entire metabolic network balance, especially with regards to NADH generation, and this knowledge is essential for generating accurate predictive metabolic models. Second, it was determined that the partial serine cycle present in Type I methanotrophs does not play a significant role during growth on methane. However, it was discovered that it does play a role during growth on methanol. Growth on methanol was discovered to involve a substantially rearranged metabolic network compared to methane, in complete contrast to literature expectations. In this case, the TCA cycle is broken, NADH is generated mainly from formate oxidation, and flux shifts from the Embden-Meyer-Parnas pathway to the Entner-Douderoff pathway. In addition, substantial carbon is redirected to synthesis of glycogen and excretion of formate. We have concluded that both metabolic flux analysis and metabolomics are extremely valuable tools in understanding the metabolic network of methylotrophs, and their use has corrected metabolic misunderstanding that has been in the literature for decades. These methods must be tailored for the C1 assimilation system, and the results presented in this thesis demonstrate an approach for the two main types of methylotrophs. These new techniques are now ready to use for investigating other methylotrophs in the future, and to serve as important tools for future metabolic engineering of methylotrophs for biotechnology applications.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed March 29, 2017). 0aMicrobial metabolism. 0aMethylotrophic microorganisms. 0aMethylobacterium extorquensxMetabolism. 7aMethylobacterium extorquensxMetabolism.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01766103 7aMethylotrophic microorganisms.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01018783 7aMicrobial metabolism.2fast0(OCoLC)fst010195220 a13C metabolic flux analysis0 aMetabolism0 aMetabolomics0 aMethylotrophs0 aChemical engineering 4aThesesxChemical engineering 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aLidstrom, Mary E.,edegree supervisor.40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/38082  aWAUW05024cam a2200469Ii 45000010011000000080041000110060019000520050017000710070014000880400044001021000040001462450166001862640063003522640011004153000072004263360026004983370026005243380036005503470021005863470008006075000010006155020044006255040057006695203124007265880097038506500027039476500031039746500036040056500042040416500017040836500057041006500062041576500068042196500043042876530025043306550028043556550034043836550047044177000044044648560037045080490009045451083644099190130t20182018waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20190731191936.9cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdOCLCFdWAUdOCL1 aGalvan, Daniel David,cII,eauthor.10aImproved performance in plasmonic biosensors for bacterial detection through dielectric conditioning and dielectrophoretic enhancement /cDaniel David Galvan II. 1a[Seattle] :b[University of Washington Libraries],c[2018] 4c©2018  a1 online resource (xxi, 151 pages) :billustrations (chiefly color)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext file2rdaft  bPDF  aVita.  bPh.

Current culture based methods are time consuming, and more efficient technologies would benefit wideranging fields including food safety, biomedicine, homeland security, and environmental monitoring. Plasmonic biosensing, such as surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) or surface plasmon resonance (SPR), can afford real-time interrogation of the unique biochemical composition of pathogenic bacteria. However, plasmonic measurements, void of complex labels or long integration times, are typically conducted with concentrated samples (10⁸ CFU/mL) of pure cultures that are far outside the clinically relevant range. Real-world samples are often dilute (< 10³ CFU/mL), and present in bacterial mixtures and/or complex media. The objective of this work is to develop SERS and SPR-based approaches to enable realtime detection of dilute and/or mixed bacterial samples. To combat these issues, we have developed a two-pronged plasmonic-based approach using: (1) long-range SERS (LR-SERS) devices to extend the effective sensing volume, and (2) SERS and SPR microfluidic devices integrated with dielectrophoresis (DEP) for the concentration and selective detection of bacterial targets. In the former, SERS-active nanohole arrays (NHAs) were embedded in refractive indexmatched environments, and resulted in extension of the effective sensing region. Finite difference time-domain simulations were conducted to investigate the plasmonic response of NHAs in symmetric and asymmetric dielectric environments. The optimal structures were fabricated, and the SERS signals of surface bound analytes dramatically increased when placed in the refractive index-matched environment. Furthermore, SERS signals were observed at a distance of 10 nm from the nanohole array surface. The increased penetration depth could enable examination of the unique bacterial composition between the peripheral cell wall and cytoplasm. In the latter, DEP was incorporated into the SERS biosensor by dual-function, nanostructured electrodes. "Point-and-plate" and "interdigitated" electrode configurations were studied with respect to SERS detection performance. Generally, bacteria localize on the sensing surface in regions with high or low electric field gradients depending on the unique cellular dielectric properties. The effect of the applied AC frequency on the capture efficiency and SERS signals of bacteria was investigated for the point-and-plate configuration. Application of DEP afforded the successful detection of 10⁵ CFU/mL E. coli solutions, and the applied electric fields did not alter the SERS spectra of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Additionally, DEP-active SPR chips containing interdigitated electrodes enable sensitive, rapid, and selective E. coli detection. The DEP-SPR strategy enabled sensitive detection of E. coli, with a limit of detection of 3 x 10² CFU/mL. Integration of secondary antibody amplification led to selective detection of E. coli in the presence of concentrated (10⁸ CFU/mL) non-target bacteria in ~2 h.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed January 30, 2019). 0aBiosensorsxMaterials. 0aSurface plasmon resonance. 0aRaman effect, Surface enhanced. 0aPathogenic microorganismsxDetection. 0aDielectrics. 7aSurface plasmon resonance.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01139231 7aRaman effect, Surface enhanced.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01089673 7aPathogenic microorganismsxDetection.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01054936 7aDielectrics.2fast0(OCoLC)fst008931220 aChemical engineering 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft 4aThesesxChemical engineering. 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst017264531 aYu, Qiuming,d1963-edegree supervisor.40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/42993  aWAUW02748cam a2200481Ii 4500001001000000008004100010006001900051005001700070007001400087040005300101100004000154245015300194264006300347264001100410300005600421336002600477337002600503338003600529347001900565347000800584502004800592504005100640520095500691588009801646650005101744650003501795650001401830650004001844650006101884653001601945653001301961653001501974653002001989653001202009653002502021653002202046655003402068655004702102655002802149700004302177856003702220049000902257964633534161130t20162016waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20190717165636.2cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdOCLCFdWAUdOCLCQdOCLCO1 aGawade, Prathamesh Milind,eauthor.10aLogic-based delivery of site-specifically-modified proteins from gels through engineered biomacromolecular architecture /cPrathamesh Milind Gawade. 1a[Seattle] :b[University of Washington Libraries],c[2016] 4c©2016  a1 online resource (57 pages) :bcolor illustrations  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext file2rda  bPDF  bM.S.

However, these delivery platforms are often restricted to a single programmed stimulus. Designing a simple, modular system which can deliver multiple proteins in response to multiple external cues still remains a challenge. In this work, we have built stimuli-degradable peptide linkers programmed with Boolean logic gates (YES/OR/AND). Through our logic-programmed peptide linkers, we demonstrate the ability to tether a variety of proteins to the hydrogel network and release these proteins in response to user-specified combination of different environmental stimuli. Utilizing this approach, we have shown that different proteins can be independently and differentially released from the same hydrogel. We believe that our system will provide the ability to exploit new opportunities in protein delivery and tissue culture application.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed November 30, 2016). 0aProteinsxTherapeutic usexControlled release. 0aControlled release technology. 0aColloids. 7aColloids.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00868334 7aControlled release technology.2fast0(OCoLC)fst008771090 aDegradation0 aHydrogel0 aPatterning0 aProtein release0 aSortase0 aChemical engineering0 aMaterials Science 4aThesesxChemical engineering. 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aDeForest, Cole A.,edegree supervisor.40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/37054  aWAUW02865cam a2200493Ii 45000010011000000080041000110060019000520050017000710070014000880400065001021000029001672450103001962640063002992640011003623000056003733360026004293370026004553380036004813470021005173470008005385000010005465020043005565040055005995201151006545880099018056500019019046500045019236530017019686530018019856530011020036530017020146530018020316530011020496530017020606530019020776530025020966550033021216550047021546550028022017000043022297000053022728560037023250490009023621004241009170918t20172017waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20190522011440.0cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdOCLCOdWAUdOCLCFdOCLdOCLCQdOCLCO1 aGilman, Alexey,eauthor.10aDevelopment of a promising methanotrophic bacterium as an industrial biocatalyst /cAlexey Gilman. 1a[Seattle] :b[University of Washington Libraries],c[2017] 4c©2017  a1 online resource (92 pages) :bcolor illustrations  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext file2rdaft  bPDF  aVita.  bPh.

A significant amount of energy is wasted in the form of natural gas flaring. This mostly occurs in remote locations where transportation or conversion of methane is not economical. Methanotrophic bacteria are ubiquitous in nature, and have the unique capability of utilizing methane as the sole source of carbon and energy. These organisms have high potential in biotechnological application for converting methane into liquid fuels at the relatively small scale required for such remote locations. Presently however, knowledge gaps in methanotrophy stand in the way of developing an economically viable process for the biological catalysis of methane. In this work, we have focused the research efforts toward an industrially promising methanotrophic bacterium in 3 parts: (i) Baseline strain parameter characterization under varying growth conditions. (ii) Investigation of a hypothesized metabolism for excretion of high titers of organic acids. (iii) Exploratory transcriptomics data-analysis study involving copper (Cu), a key metal in methane oxidation.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed September 18, 2017). 0aMethanotrophs. 7aMethanotrophs.2fast0(OCoLC)fst017459790 aBiocatalysis0 aBioconversion0 aCopper0 aFermentation0 aMethanotrophy0 aEnergy0 aMicrobiology0 aBioinformatics0 aChemical engineering 4aThesesxChemical engineering 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aLidstrom, Mary E.,edegree supervisor.1 aBeck, David Andrew Crawford,edegree supervisor.40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/39973  aWAUW02830cam a2200505Ii 45000010011000000080041000110060019000520050017000710070014000880400058001021000034001602450112001942640063003062640011003693000066003803360026004463370026004723380036004983470021005343470008005555020048005635040055006115200937006665880097016036500022017006500031017226500021017536500022017746500048017966500057018446500047019016500048019486530015019966530028020116530021020396530015020606530025020756530017021006550033021176550047021506550028021977000053022258560037022780490009023151077480470181204t20182018waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20190803135220.8cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdOCLCFdWAUdOCLCQdOCLCOdOCL1 aGuo, Jiayuan,d1995-eauthor.10aDeveloping a visualization tool for unsupervised machine learning techniques on *omics data /cJiayuan Guo. 1a[Seattle] :b[University of Washington Libraries],c[2018] 4c©2018  a1 online resource (22 pages) :billustrations (chiefly color)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext file2rdaft  bPDF  bM.S.

The objective of this work is to develop new methodologies to study proteins and complex mixtures of proteins immobilized onto surfaces. The focus of this study was to control and characterize the orientation of protein G B1, an IgG antibody-binding domain of protein G, on well-defined surfaces as well as measure the effect of protein G B1 orientation on IgG antibody binding using a variety of surface analytical and computational techniques. The surface sensitivity of time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) was used to distinguish between different proteins and their orientation by monitoring the changes in intensity of characteristic amino acid mass fragments. Amino acids distributed asymmetrically were used to calculate peak intensity ratios from ToF-SIMS data to determine the orientation of five different cysteine mutants of protein G B1 covalently attached to a maleimide surface. To study the effect of protein orientation on antibody binding, we formed multilayer protein films by binding IgG to protein G B1 films. Quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D) detected protein coverages of 69 - 130 ng/cm² (theoretical mass of a monolayer of protein G B1 is 110 - 160 ng/cm²). QCM-D and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis revealed that packing density along with orientation affected the antibody binding process. Spectra from ToF-SIMS using large Ar gas cluster ion sources distinguished between different proteins in multilayer protein systems. A Monte Carlo algorithm was developed to predict protein orientation on surfaces. Two distinct orientations of protein G B1 adsorbed onto a hydrophobic surface were found and characterized as two mutually exclusive sets of amino acids on the outermost [Beta]-sheets contacting the surface. This prediction was consistent with sum frequency generation (SFG) vibrational spectroscopy results. In fact, theoretical SFG spectra calculated from an equal combination of the two predicted orientations exhibited reasonable agreement with measured spectra of protein G B1 on polystyrene surfaces. These results show that computational methods to study proteins on surfaces can complement surface analytical data. 0aImmobilized proteinsxConformation. 0aImmunoglobulin G. 0aProtein binding. 0aSurface chemistry. 0aTime-of-flight mass spectrometry. 0aSecondary ion mass spectrometry. 7aImmunoglobulin G2fast0(OCoLC)fst00967955 7aProtein binding.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01079673 7aSecondary ion mass spectrometry.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01110604 7aSurface chemistry.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01139210 7aTime-of-flight mass spectrometry.2fast0(OCoLC)fst011511870 aBiomaterials0 aImmobilization0 aMonte Carlo0 aMultitechnique0 aProteins0 aSurface analysis0 aChemical engineering0 aBiomedical engineering0 aMaterials Science 4aThesesxChemical engineering 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aCastner, David Gordon,edegree supervisor.1 aInterlandi, Gianluca,edegree supervisor.40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/39979  aWAUW03931cam a2200445Ii 45000010011000000080041000110060019000520050017000710070014000880400044001021000032001462450094001782640063002722640011003353000064003463360026004103370026004363380036004623470021004983470008005195020044005275040057005715202225006285880098028536500048029516500021029996500012030206500022030326500048030546500038031026500047031406500074031876530025032616550034032866550047033206550028033677000044033958560037034390490009034761117715398190909t20192019waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20200130213205.3cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdOCLCFdWAUdOCL1 aHellner, Brittney,eauthor.10aCorrelating solid-binding peptide structure with biomimetic function /cBrittney Hellner. 1a[Seattle] :b[University of Washington Libraries],c[2019] 4c©2019  a1 online resource (142 pages) :billustrations (some color)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext file2rdaft  bPDF  bPh.

This is in part due to a poor understanding of the relationship between SBP conformation and inorganic adhesion and precipitation. This dissertation focuses on correlating the structure of Car9, a SiO₂/TiO₂-binding dodecapeptide originally isolated for its ability to recognize the edges of graphitic nanostructures, with silica binding affinity and titania precipitation activity. We start by quantifying the binding kinetics of a fusion protein between superfolder green fluorescent (sfGFP) and the Car9 SBP to silica using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) measurements, develop a two-step kinetic model that accurately captures the unique cooperative adhesion behavior of the fusion protein, and demonstrate that elimination of multiple basic residues converts the binding to a Langmuir process. Using a panel of mutants in the Car9 segment, we combine SPR characterization and molecular dynamics simulations initiated from Rosetta structural predictions to gain insights on the interplay of amino acid composition, structure, and adhesion modality. We show that the high affinity binding of Car9 to silica stems from persistent electrostatic interaction with the surface that, along with high surface coverage, promotes cooperative interactions between neighboring SBPs. Additionally, we ascribe the transition to Langmuir adhesion to the loss of two or more such contacts due to mutagenesis. Finally, we show mutations in the Car9 extension biases the crystallinity of titania bioprecipitated by sfGFP-Car9 fusion proteins between anatase and TiO₂ (B) phases and harness our knowledge of SiO₂ adhesion to interpret these results. Collectively, our results provide a roadmap for developing a fundamental understanding of SBPs' inorganic adhesion and offers insight in how to intuitively design peptide-protein scaffolds to produce unique composite materials for applications ranging from biomedical engineering to catalysis.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed September 9, 2019). 0aPeptidesxStructure-activity relationships. 0aProtein binding. 0aSilica. 0aTitanium dioxide. 7aTitanium dioxide.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01151576 7aSilica.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01118585 7aProtein binding.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01079673 7aPeptidesxStructure-activity relationships.2fast0(OCoLC)fst010575790 aChemical engineering 4aThesesxChemical engineering. 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aBaneyx, François,edegree supervisor.40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/44095  aWAUW03984cam a2200469Ii 4500001001000000008004100010006001900051005001700070007001400087040005300101100003000154245008900184264006300273264001100336300005500347336002600402337002600428338003600454347001900490347000800509502004300517504005700560520234700617588009702964650001503061650002403076650005003100650004103150653001203191653002103203653001103224653002103235653001403256653002503270653002303295655003403318655004703352655002803399700004103427856003703468049000903505960979171161021t20162016waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20190712181622.2cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdOCLCFdWAUdOCLCQdOCLCO1 aHough, Blake R.,eauthor.10aComputational approaches and tools for modeling biomass pyrolysis /cBlake R.

However, industrial pyrolysis processes to make these products from biomass are not yet economically viable and require significant optimization before they can contribute to existing oil-based transportation and chemical systems. One means of optimization uses kinetic and transport models for predicting the products of biomass pyrolysis, which serve as the basis for designing pyrolysis reactors capable of producing the highest value products. The goal of this work is to improve upon current pyrolysis models using computational fluid dynamics, detailed kinetic schemes, and machine learning. First, we develop a comprehensive two-dimensional particle model for wood pyrolysis that incorporates a multi-step semi-global reaction mechanism, prescribed particle shrinkage, and thermophysical properties that vary with temperature, composition, and orientation. This model is used to validate a new experimental technique that is capable of measuring the carbohydrate composition during fast pyrolysis under industrial conditions for the first time. Motivated by the challenges and limitations we encountered while developing this particle model, we next present a detailed kinetic model capable of predicting the temporal evolution of molecules and functional groups during lignin pyrolysis. This kinetic model provides information beyond the lumped yields of common pyrolysis models without any fitting, allowing it to cover a wider range of feedstocks and reaction conditions than lumped models. We perform an exhaustive sensitivity analysis using over two million simulations to explore which reactions contribute most to variance in the model predictions. Due to their computational expense, detailed kinetic models cannot be incorporated into comprehensive particle models that account for both kinetics and transport effects. To address this problem we demonstrate a machine learning approach to kinetic model reduction using neural networks that reduces the computational cost of our detailed kinetic model by four orders of magnitude. The trained neural networks generalize very well, predicting the outputs of the kinetic model with over 99.9% accuracy on new data.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed October 21, 2016). 0aPyrolysis. 0aBiomass conversion. 7aBiomass conversion.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00832528 7aPyrolysis.2fast0(OCoLC)fst010846790 aBiomass0 aKinetic modeling0 aLignin0 aMachine learning0 aPyrolysis0 aChemical engineering0 aAlternative energy 4aThesesxChemical engineering. 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aPfaendtner, Jim,edegree supervisor.40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/37051  aWAUW02753cam a2200397Ii 45000010011000000080041000110060019000520050017000710070014000880400065001021000034001672450071002012640063002722640011003353000056003463360026004023370026004283380036004543470021004903470008005115020048005195040055005675201284006225880099019066500033020056500023020386500049020616530022021106530025021326550033021576550047021906550028022377000044022658560037023090490009023461004241058170918t20172017waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20190522011433.1cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdOCLCOdWAUdOCLCFdOCLdOCLCQdOCLCO1 aHsu, ChiaWei,d1992-eauthor.10aMineralization of titania with sfGFP-Car9 variants /cChiaWei Hsu. 1a[Seattle] :b[University of Washington Libraries],c[2017] 4c©2017  a1 online resource (40 pages) :bcolor illustrations  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext file2rdaft  bPDF  bM.S.

It offers an environmentally friendly alternative for synthesizing inorganic compared to traditional processing and fabrication routes that involve energy-intensive and high temperature processes. In this work, we investigate how variants of superfolder green fluorescent protein (sfGFP) incorporating a panel of solid binding peptides (SBPs) modulate the precipitation of titania (TiO2) under non-equilibrium conditions using a new coffee ring effect (CRE) biomineralization approach. By depositing a small droplet containing various engineered solid-binding peptides on an agarose substrate supplemented with the soluble titanium precursor, titanium(IV) bis(ammonium lactato) dihydroxide (TiBALDH). We show that diffusion-reaction leads to the formation of distinct patterns of precipitated TiO2. Using image analysis and SEM, we take the first steps towards correlating the macroscopic and microscopic characteristics of the dynamically formed precipitate with protein concentration, solution viscosity, and with the amino acid composition, insertion point, and valency of the SBPs incorporated within the sfGFP framework.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed September 18, 2017). 0aTitanium dioxidexSynthesis. 0aBiomineralization. 7aBiomineralization.2fast0(OCoLC)fst008326220 aMolecular biology0 aChemical engineering 4aThesesxChemical engineering 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aBaneyx, François,edegree supervisor.40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/39974  aWAUW02724cam a2200481Ii 45000010011000000080041000110060019000520050017000710070014000880400065001021000027001672450091001942640063002852640011003483000061003593360026004203370026004463380036004723470021005083470008005295020048005375040055005855200908006405880097015486500041016456500050016866500027017366500076017636500053018396530016018926530021019086530027019296530023019566530021019796530015020006530025020156550033020406550047020736550028021207000048021488560037021960490009022331014345591171208t20172017waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20190429175833.1cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdOCLCOdOCLCFdWAUdOCLdOCLCQdOCLCO1 aJang, Taejin,eauthor.10aOrthogonal collocation on finite element method for driven cavity flow /cTaejin Jang. 1a[Seattle] :b[University of Washington Libraries],c[2017] 4c©2017  a1 online resource (iii, 39 pages) :bcolor illustrations  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext file2rdaft  bPDF  bM.S.

A significant challenge in the field remains to relate the chemical structure of these materials with their morphology and dynamics, which in turn affect their charge transport characteristics. There are several experimental and computational methods that are commonly used when characterizing conjugated polymers. In this work, we attempt to synergistically apply these techniques so as to obtain a clear understanding of the properties that affect the structure and dynamics of conjugated polymers. A large experimental data set is used to validate molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of poly(3-hexylthiophene), a model conjugated polymer system. A sensitivity analysis of system and simulation parameters is performed, and the key factors affecting the conjugated polymer dynamics and configuration are found to be molecular weight, crystallinity, equilibration method, and force field parameters. Specifically, the atomistic partial charges are found to have the greatest influence on both properties. The identification of these key parameters will inform further studies of more complex conjugated polymer systems, elucidating the relationship between conjugated polymer chemistry and performance.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed March 29, 2017). 0aConjugated polymers. 0aSemiconductorsxCharacterization. 0aMolecular dynamics. 7aConjugated polymers.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01741276 7aMolecular dynamics.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01024778 7aSemiconductorsxCharacterization.2fast0(OCoLC)fst011122020 aConjugated Polymer0 aMolecular Dynamics Simulation0 aNeutron Scattering0 aPolymer Dynamics0 aX-Ray Scattering0 aChemical engineering0 aPolymer chemistry 4aThesesxChemical engineering 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aPozzo, Lilo D.,edegree supervisor.40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/38081  aWAUW03259cam a2200541Ii 45000010011000000080041000110060019000520050017000710070014000880400044001021000030001462450087001762640063002632640011003263000080003373360026004173370026004433380036004693470021005053470008005265020044005345040059005785201302006375880098019396500031020376500030020686500018020986500026021166500052021426500044021946500056022386500057022946530012023516530017023636530016023806530018023966530018024146530024024326530025024566530019024816530022025006550034025226550047025566550028026037000040026318560037026710490009027081128832866191125t20192019waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20200714230016.0cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdOCLCFdWAUdOCL1 aKastilani, Ryan,eauthor.10aSynthesis and surface engineering towards complex nanomaterials /cRyan Kastilani. 1a[Seattle] :b[University of Washington Libraries],c[2019] 4c©2019  a1 online resource (xii, 170 unnumbered pages) :billustrations (some color)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext file2rdaft  bPDF  bPh.

Throughout the last couple of decades, the ever increasing demand for technology have driven not only the quest for new nanomaterials, but also efficient ways to produce them. In this work, novel methods towards producing complex nanomaterials is presented: from molecules to product. In the first part, a method to synthesize quantum dots (QD) from molecular precursors using ultrasound, in an emulsion system under controlled temperature, is presented. This method offers remarkable temporal control, leading to on-demand synthesis of QDs, and has 10x production capacity compared to the typical single-phase sonochemical synthesis of QDs. In the second part, a general bottom-up method to assemble two different kinds of nanoparticles together by engineering the nanoparticle surface is presented, which opens the path towards scalable production of multifunctional nanomaterials. Finally, a specific application of surface engineering and particle assembly is demonstrated in the context of reducing the brittleness of ceramic membranes for energy storage applications.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed November 25, 2019). 0aNanocomposites (Materials) 0aNanostructured materials. 0aQuantum dots. 0aSurfaces (Technology) 7aSurfaces (Technology)2fast0(OCoLC)fst01139278 7aQuantum dots.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01085097 7aNanostructured materials.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01032630 7aNanocomposites (Materials)2fast0(OCoLC)fst017486790 aColloid0 aNanoparticle0 aQuantum dot0 aSelf-assembly0 aSonochemistry0 aSurface engineering0 aChemical engineering0 aNanotechnology0 aMaterials Science 4aThesesxChemical engineering. 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aPozzo, Lilo D.,edegree supervisor.40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/44745  aWAUW03531cam a2200433Ii 4500001001000000008004100010006001900051005001700070007001400087040006500101100003900166245007900205264006300284264001100347300005500358336002600413337002600439338003600465347002400501500001000525502004300535504005600578520188500634588009302519650003502612650002502647650002302672650004902695650006102744650005102805653001102856653002502867655003302892655004702925655002802972700005103000856003703051049000903088988540580170531t20172017waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20190524172317.5cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdOCLCFdOCLCOdWAUdOCLdOCLCQdOCLCO1 aKatahara, John K.,d1988-eauthor.10aIlluminating the potential of thin-film photovoltaics /cJohn K.

Solution processing of thin-film PV is one promising way to reduce the capital expenditure (CAPEX) of manufacturing solar cells. However, it is imperative that a shift to solution processing does not come at the expense of device performance. One particularly problematic parameter for thin-film PV has historically been the open-circuit voltage (VOC). As such, there is a pressing need for characterization tools that allow us to quickly and accurately evaluate the potential performance of solution-processed PV absorber layers. This work describes recent progress in developing photoluminescence (PL) techniques for probing optoelectronic quality in semiconductors. We present a generalized model of absorption that encompasses ideal direct-gap semiconductor absorption and various band tail models. This powerful absorption model is used to fit absolute intensity PL data and extract quasi-Fermi level splitting (maximum attainable VOC) for a variety of PV absorber technologies. This technique obviates the need for full device fabrication to get feedback on optoelectronic quality of PV absorber layers and has expedited materials exploration. We then use this absorption model to evaluate the thermodynamic losses due to different band tail cases and estimate tail losses in Cu2ZnSn(S, Se)4 (CZTSSe). The effect of sub-bandgap absorption on PL quantum yield (PLQY) and voltage is elucidated, and new analysis techniques for extracting VOC from PLQY are validated that reduce computation time and provide us even faster feedback on material quality. We then use PL imaging to develop a mechanism describing the degradation of solution-processed CH3NH3PbI3 films under applied bias and illumination.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed May 26, 2017). 0aPhotovoltaic cellsxMaterials. 0aSemiconductor films. 0aPhotoluminescence. 7aPhotoluminescence.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01062036 7aPhotovoltaic cellsxMaterials.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01062160 7aSemiconductor films.2fast0(OCoLC)fst011121280 aEnergy0 aChemical engineering 4aThesesxChemical engineering 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aHillhouse, Hugh W.,d1972-edegree supervisor.40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/38590  aWAUW04553cam a2200493Ii 45000010011000000080041000110060019000520050017000710070014000880400070001021000028001722450099002002640063002992640011003623000060003733360026004333370026004593380036004853470021005213470008005425020043005505040055005935202767006485880097034156500027035126500017035396500022035566500053035786500048036316500043036796530014037226530015037366530021037516530017037726530018037896530027038076530025038346550033038596550047038926550028039397000046039678560037040130490009040501014345476171208t20172017waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20190429175817.3cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdOCLCOdWAUdOCLCFdWAUdOCLdOCLCQdOCLCO1 aKerr, Gary J.,eauthor.10aIsotachophoresis enhanced point-of-care immunoassays for clinical diagnostics /cGary J.

The first and most prevalent lateral flow assay is the pregnancy test. Lateral flow assays are low cost, rapid, and simple to operate. However, lateral flow immunoassays have been limited in their success due to poor performance related to an inability to detect low analyte concentrations. In this thesis, we aim to create a high-performance point-of-care immunoassay by integrating sample concentration into a sandwich immunoassay. We use a method called isotachophoresis (ITP) to enhance the detection of low analyte concentrations in the lateral flow format. We present the performance characteristics for a lateral flow enhanced with ITP diagnostic (LID) assay for the detection of strep throat and the detection of chlamydia. We additionally put forth a method for investigating parameters that are important for the performance of LID assays. Lastly, we validate the LID format in clinically relevant samples. We show a limit-of-detection of strep throat cells in clean buffer to be 2000 CFU/mL, an improvement of more than 100-fold over a commercial lateral flow assay. This assay also demonstrates an improvement in the analytical sensitivity when compared to the commercial assay. We also present the detection of chlamydia in the LID format demonstrating a 3-fold improvement over a commercial lateral flow assay. The dramatic difference in improvement when comparing the streptococcus assay to chlamydia motivated an investigation into the parameters that are important when using isotachophoresis to enhance the performance of a lateral flow assay. For designing the chemistry of a LID assay, it is important to investigate the ionic strength (IS), pH and lysis chemistry. Each of these parameters affect the binding of antibody to antigen, as well as the performance of the ITP. Designing with both the binding and ITP performance in mind can be difficult. We present guidelines for obtaining and utilizing these parameter effects in the chemistry design. We develop a model to calculate the limit-of-detection for lateral flow and LID assays from antibody and assay parameters. This model shows that the benefit of a LID assay can be limited by non-specific binding between label and capture antibodies. The model finds that ITP is the most beneficial to antibody pairs with low non-specific affinities. Finally, we test the strep throat LID assay in contrived clinical samples to validate the compatibility of the format with clinical samples. Our assay is able to successfully differentiate positive from negative samples in these clinically relevant samples. Our assay identifies all positive samples in the expected clinical range.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed December 8, 2017). 0aPoint-of-care testing. 0aImmunoassay. 0aIsotachophoresis. 7aPoint-of-care testing.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01068112 7aIsotachophoresis.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00980217 7aImmunoassay.2fast0(OCoLC)fst009679210 aChlamydia0 aDiagnostic0 aIsotachophoresis0 aLateral Flow0 aStreptococcus0 aHealth care management0 aChemical engineering 4aThesesxChemical engineering 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aPosner, Jonathan Dov,edegree supervisor.40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/40513  aWAUW03073cam a2200421Ii 45000010011000000080041000110060019000520050017000710070014000880400044001021000035001462450136001812640063003172640011003803000056003913360026004473370026004733380036004993470021005353470008005565020050005645040041006145201491006555880097021466500028022436500016022716500054022876500042023416530028023836530016024116530025024276550028024526550034024806550047025147000044025618560037026050490009026421083644054190130t20182018waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20190731191926.5cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdOCLCFdWAUdOCL1 aLee, Hyunjong,d1990-eauthor.10aStudies and optimization of all-polymer solar cells based on naphthalene diimide-biselenophene copolymer acceptors /cHyunjong Lee. 1a[Seattle] :b[University of Washington Libraries],c[2018] 4c©2018  a1 online resource (90 pages) :bcolor illustrations  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext file2rdaft  bPDF  bM.S.

Studies and understanding of fullerene-based polymer solar cells have led to a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 12%. However, such fullerene-based OPVs are not stable in air, among other disadvantages. This thesis mainly focuses on studies all-polymer solar cells (all-PCSs) based on naphthalene diimide-biselenophene copolymer acceptors and aims to better understand the relationship between photovoltaic properties, blend morphology, and device processing variables. In this study, we found that optimal thermal annealing and use of a processing additive facilitated favorable blend morphology and enhanced photovoltaic properties in an active layer composed of a high molecular weight (Mn) acceptor polymer, PNDIBS, and a donor polymer, PBDB-T, with complementary absorption bands. We observed a PCE of over 9% in optimized PBDB-T:PNDIBS blend devices. In addition, all-PCSs based on donor PBDB-T and random copolymer acceptors, BSSx (x=10, 20, and 50), were found to have improved morphology, due to the fine tuned bulk crystallinity of the random copolymers. Finally, we explored solution-processed electron transport layers (ETLs) as a way to engineer the cathode interface of the all-PCSs and found that ETLs doped with alkali metal salt can also further enhance the device performance due to the better charge extraction at the cathode.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed January 30, 2019). 0aSolar cellsxMaterials. 0aCopolymers. 7aSolar cellsxMaterials.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01124941 7aCopolymers.2fast0(OCoLC)fst008783280 aAll-Polymer Solar Cells0 aEngineering0 aChemical engineering 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft 4aThesesxChemical engineering. 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst017264531 aJenekhe, Samson A.,edegree supervisor.40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/42991  aWAUW03502cam a2200493Ii 45000010011000000080041000110060019000520050017000710070014000880400044001021000029001462450117001752640063002922640011003553000071003663360026004373370026004633380036004893470021005253470008005465000010005545020044005645040057006085201682006655880098023476500048024456500035024936500035025286500030025636500056025936500061026496530012027106530011027226530014027336530017027476530016027646530025027806550034028056550047028396550028028867000048029148560037029620490009029991128832922191125t20192019waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20200714230020.3cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdOCLCFdWAUdOCL1 aLee, Seongbeom,eauthor.10aIntegrating energy storage systems into renewable grid applications :ba model-based approach /cSeong Beom Lee. 1a[Seattle] :b[University of Washington Libraries],c[2019] 4c©2019  a1 online resource (xi, 128 pages) :billustrations (chiefly color)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext file2rdaft  bPDF  aVita.  bPh.

Typically, batteries are treated as a black box that does not account for their internal states in current renewable grid simulations. This might lead to under-utilization and over-stacking of batteries. In contrast, detailed physics-based battery models, accounting for internal states, can save a significant amount of energy and cost, utilizing batteries with maximized life and usability. Therefore, it is important to identify how efficient physics-based models of batteries can be included and addressed in grid control strategies. In this dissertation, an efficient battery/grid integration framework will be studied and analyzed. Simple examples for microgrids and the direct simulation of the same including physics-based battery models will be presented. A representative microgrid example, which integrates stand-alone PV arrays, a maximum power point tracking controller, lithium-ion batteries, and power electronics, is illustrated.

However, their potential use for photothermal therapy has not yet been evaluated in depth. Herein, the photothermal conversion efficiency of several copper chalcogenide alloy NCs were investigated to evaluate the potential use of each as a photothermal agent via a comparison with unalloyed copper sulfide NCs. By controlling the composition of the alloys, their localized surface plasmon resonance peaks could be tuned throughout the near-infrared region, potentially leading to materials with resonances more closely matched to ideal therapeutic windows. Moreover, it was found that the photothermal conversion efficiency increased relative to the copper sulfide NCs as the LSPR peaks were tuned more closely to the 808 nm laser wavelength used in this study - directly within the center of the tissue transparency window.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed November 30, 2016). 0aPhototherapy. 0aCopper compounds. 0aChalcogenides. 0aNanocrystals. 7aChalcogenides.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00851857 7aCopper compounds.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00878450 7aNanocrystals.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01032622 7aPhototherapy.2fast0(OCoLC)fst010621390 aCopper chacogenide nanocrystals0 aLocalized surface plasmon resonances (LSPRs)0 aPhotothermal conversion efficiency0 aPhotothermal therapy0 aEngineering0 aChemical engineering 4aThesesxChemical engineering. 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aHolmberg, Vincent Carl,edegree supervisor.40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/37052  aWAUW03971cam a2200493Ii 45000010011000000080041000110060019000520050017000710070014000880400044001021000034001462450114001802640063002942640011003573000072003683360026004403370026004663380036004923470021005283470008005495000010005575020044005675040057006115202186006685880098028546500011029526500015029636500028029786500054030066500041030606500037031016530023031386530013031616530035031746530033032096530015032426530025032576550034032826550047033166550028033637000040033918560037034310490009034681128832822191125t20192019waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20200714230002.5cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdOCLCFdWAUdOCL1 aLee, Yi-Ting,d1987-eauthor.10aUnravelling synthesis and transport phenomena in emulsion systems with small angle scattering /cYi-Ting Lee. 1a[Seattle] :b[University of Washington Libraries],c[2019] 4c©2019  a1 online resource (xvi, 193 pages) :billustrations (chiefly color)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext file2rdaft  bPDF  aVita.  bPh.

These dispersions of droplets are intrinsically unstable and would phase separate if no stabilizers were present. Even if the emulsions are stabilized, the emulsion system is still extremely dynamic and multiple phenomena could occur simultaneously to affect the stability of the dispersion. Therefore, fundamentally understanding how the droplets interact with each other is crucial when designing emulsion-based products. Small angle scattering is a unique technique that can provide information of a sample in its native environment. Moreover, custom-built sample environments could also be utilized with this technique to provide additional controllable parameters such as the application of acoustic forces to alter the dynamics in emulsion system. Thus, small angle scattering is an optimal method for characterizing emulsion systems. In this dissertation, three different fundamental interactions that occur in emulsion systems are probed using both small angle X-ray scattering and small angle neutron scattering. The role of acoustic forces in solid particle stabilized Pickering emulsion formation using sonication is first investigated. Cavitation events are found to be crucial in inducing particle adsorption onto the oil-water interface. Mass transport kinetics between emulsions are also presented in this dissertation. When the emulsions are at rest, oil molecules can exchange between oil droplets spontaneously by directly diffusing through the aqueous phase or via direct emulsion contact. When emulsions are sonicated, the acoustic-force induced cavitation can significantly accelerate the oil exchange process. Moreover, the electrostatic repulsion, Gibbs elasticity of the oil-water interface provided by the presence of surfactants, and the emulsion size all played a role in the acoustic force induced oil exchange process. This dissertation will demonstrate our work towards understanding the interactions in emulsion systems on a molecular scale to provide a fundamental knowledge on how to design an emulsion-based system.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed November 25, 2019). 0aDrops. 0aEmulsions. 0aSmall-angle scattering. 7aSmall-angle scattering.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01121500 7aEmulsions.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00909435 7aDrops.2fast0(OCoLC)fst008983800 aContrast Variation0 aEmulsion0 aSmall Angle Neutron Scattering0 aSmall Angle X-Ray Scattering0 aUltrasound0 aChemical engineering 4aThesesxChemical engineering. 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aPozzo, Lilo D.,edegree supervisor.40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/44741  aWAUW03091cam a2200361Ii 45000010011000000080041000110060019000520050017000710070014000880400039001021000033001412450080001742640063002542640011003173000063003283360026003913370026004173380036004433470021004793470008005005020049005085040055005575201747006125880099023596500046024586530025025046550034025296550047025636550028026107000045026388560037026830490009027201120724225190923t20192019waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20191022201056.7cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdOCLCFdWAU1 aLi, Baochen,d1994-eauthor.10aDevelop a supercapacitor real time model for PHIL simulation /cBaochen Li. 1a[Seattle] :b[University of Washington Libraries],c[2019] 4c©2019  a1 online resource (29 pages) :billustrations (some color)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext file2rdaft  bPDF  bM.S.

Therefore, energy storage devices, like batteries and supercapacitors, are introduced into the system to ensure quality power is provided under a wide range of dynamic load conditions. Hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) and power-hardware-in-the-loop (PHIL) real time simulations are among the most reliable methods for ensuring generation and storage can meet load demands in real time, because it is executed physically rather than as a purely computational exercise. My research is focused on developing supercapacitor implementations for HIL and PHIL. For supercapacitors, equivalent circuit model can adequately represent the dynamic behavior, but this kind of model can be difficult to ascribe to physical meanings, which is significant for designing and scaling-up a commercial supercapacitor device. An expression-based equivalent circuit model is used to solve this problem. Parameters in the model can be linked with configuration parameters of an actual device. A Simulink model is then loaded in our OPAL-RT real time simulator, which together with power amplifier and programmable load, allow power hardware-in-the-loop real time supercapacitor discharge simulations. The PHIL results are shown to be limited by the ± 1 V and ±3 A hardware noise. To achieve higher voltages than allowed by a single cell, multiple cells get connected in series and parallel to achieve enough voltage and power. We show how a Simulink supercapacitor module can be built with passive balancing to achieve good module performance while limiting excessive potential on individual cells.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed September 23, 2019). 0aSupercapacitorsxDesign and construction.0 aChemical engineering 4aThesesxChemical engineering. 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aSchwartz, Daniel T.,edegree supervisor.40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/44100  aWAUW03129cam a2200481Ii 45000010011000000080041000110060019000520050017000710070014000880400058001021000032001602450175001922640063003672640011004303000067004413360026005083370026005343380036005603470021005963470008006175020048006255040055006735201315007285880097020436500028021406500016021686500016021846500042022006500054022426500042022966530018023386530026023566530015023826530019023976530008024166530025024246550033024496550047024826550028025297000044025578560037026010490009026381077777501181205t20182018waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20190803140539.4cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdOCLCFdWAUdOCLCQdOCLCOdOCL1 aLin, Yi-Yu,d1994-eauthor.10aSolvent effect on morphological, crystalline and electronic properties of triple-cation lead-tin double-halide perovskite thin films and their air stability /cYi-Yu Lin. 1a[Seattle] :b[University of Washington Libraries],c[2018] 4c©2018  a1 online resource (vi, 56 pages) :billustrations (some color)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext file2rdaft  bPDF  bM.S.

However, the replacement of Pb with Sn has not been fully developed. In this work, we focused on the investigation of the solvent effect on morphological, crystalline and electronic properties of the perovskite thin films with the compositions of Csx(MA₀.₁--FA₀.₃)₁xPb₁₋ySny(I₀.₈₃Br₀.₁-- )₃, where x = 0.05, 0.1, and 0.2 and y = 0, 0.25, 0.50 0.75, and 1.0. By optimizing the mixed solvents in making perovskite precursor solutions, anti-solvent volumes in wash step and annealing temperature, as well as adding anti-oxidation agent, we were able to fabricate pinhole-free perovskite thin films with shiny, uniform dark- color. The surface morphology, crystal structure and optical band gap were investigated using scanning electron microscope (SEM), X-Ray diffraction (XRD), and UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy. The air stability of the perovskite thin films was also assessed by acquiring SEM images and XRD patterns after the films were stored in an ambient condition for 10 days. Phase segregation occurred as shown in XRD peak shifts and white rods around grain boundaries in SEM images, which contain high Sn, Br, and F elements.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed December 5, 2018). 0aSolar cellsxMaterials. 0aPerovskite. 0aThin films. 7aThin films.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01150018 7aSolar cellsxMaterials.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01124941 7aPerovskite.2fast0(OCoLC)fst010583230 aAir Stability0 aPerovskite thin films0 aSEM Images0 aUV-Vis Spectra0 aXRD0 aChemical engineering 4aThesesxChemical engineering 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aYu, Qiuming,d1963-edegree supervisor.40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/42229  aWAUW04636cam a2200529Ii 45000010011000000080041000110060019000520050017000710070014000880400056001021000030001582450090001882640063002782640011003413000069003523360026004213370026004473380036004733470021005093470008005305000010005385020044005485040055005925202678006475880098033256500037034236500018034606500019034786500012034976500021035096500063035306500047035936500044036406500038036846500045037226530019037676530017037866530016038036530025038196530019038446550034038636550047038976550028039447000088039728560037040600490009040971117715903190909t20192019waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20210721172237.8cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdOCLCFdWAUdOCLdWAUdOCLCO1 aLiu, Erik Jerry,eauthor.10aDevelopment of mixed-charge EK polypeptides for protein protection /cErik Jerry Liu. 1a[Seattle] :b[University of Washington Libraries],c[2019] 4c©2019  a1 online resource (viii, 99 pages) :billustrations (some color)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext file2rdaft  bPDF  aVita.  bPh.

Compared to many polymers used to modify proteins, polypeptides are an ideal candidate for protein modification due to their biocompatibility, biodegradability, and uniformity. Polypeptides composed of alternating glutamic acid and lysine residues (EK) function as rationally-designed polypeptide analogues of low-fouling zwitterionic polymers due to their ability to resist nonspecific protein adsorption. Zwitterionic polymers have demonstrated superior properties related to protein protection, pharmacokinetics, and immunogenicity compared to other polymers, including poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), which has been widely used to modify therapeutic proteins in the clinic. As EK has demonstrated similar zwitterionic properties it can be used in similar capacities when used to modify therapeutic proteins. The use of EK allows for the use of recombinant protein expression techniques, thereby allowing for the synthesis of well-defined products of uniform composition without any inherent batch to batch variation. Additionally, recombinant techniques allow for EK to be a component of a fusion protein to modify target therapeutic proteins, allowing for one-step generation of any number of EK-modified products. This work develops the capabilities of EK through various systems from proof of concept through in vivo capabilities and demonstrates that EK behaves similarly to zwitterionic polymers when used to modify proteins. A proof of concept system utilized a model [Beta]-lactamase system to demonstrate the generation of fusion proteins containing EK. These fusion proteins were able to be expressed at a uniform molecular weight and purified. It was observed that EK demonstrated the conferring of the same protecting properties in vitro against environmental stressors and improvements to enzyme kinetics that zwitterionic polymers had previously demonstrated. These in vitro properties of EK were again demonstrated when EK was used as a part of a fusion protein with organophosphate hydrolase. Additionally EK exhibited its zwitterionic low-fouling characteristics by preventing the formation of the dimeric structure of wild-type organophosphate hydrolase and leaving stable monomeric structures, demonstrating the ability of EK to protect the surface of the protein from foreign interactions. This effort also represents the first known expression of a stable monomeric unit of the protein. Furthermore, other EK fusion protein systems and standalone EK peptides have also been expressed and studied.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed September 9, 2019). 0aProteinsxChemical modification. 0aPolypeptides. 0aGlutamic acid. 0aLysine. 0aPolyzwitterions. 7aProteinsxChemical modification.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01079722 7aPolyzwitterions.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01739529 7aPolypeptides.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01744214 7aLysine.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01004388 7aGlutamic acid.2fast0(OCoLC)fst009437280 aFusion Protein0 aMixed Charge0 aZwitterions0 aChemical engineering0 aBioengineering 4aThesesxChemical engineering. 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aJiang, Shaoyi,d1964-edegree supervisor.1http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q8856592040uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/44102  aWAUW03021cam a2200529Ii 45000010011000000080041000110060019000520050017000710070014000880400065001021000025001672450091001922640063002832640011003463000061003573360026004183370026004443380036004703470021005063470008005275020041005355040041005765201158006175880087017756500026018626500032018886500026019206500014019466500028019606500054019886500052020426500040020946500052021346530017021866530013022036530015022166530012022316530012022436530014022556530025022696550033022946550047023276550028023747000043024028560037024450490009024821014345474171208t20172017waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20190429175816.7cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdOCLCOdOCLCFdWAUdOCLdOCLCQdOCLCO1 aLiu, Luman,eauthor.10aCyclic stiffness photomodulation of cell-laden protein-polymer hydrogels /cLuman Liu. 1a[Seattle] :b[University of Washington Libraries],c[2017] 4c©2017  a1 online resource (iii, 25 pages) :bcolor illustrations  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext file2rdaft  bPDF  bM.S.cUniversity of Washingtond2017  aIncludes bibliographical references.3 aAlthough mechanical signals presented by the extracellular matrix are known to regulate many essential cell functions, the specific effects of these interactions, particularly in response to dynamic and heterogeneous cues, remain largely unknown.

The root cause of climate change is relatively simple to describe: atmospheric CO2 transmits visible light from the sun, but absorbs infrared light radiated by the Earth. This "greenhouse effect" makes life on Earth possible, but it is somewhat sensitive to the concentration of CO2 (and other gases) in the atmosphere. Unfortunately, solving anthropogenic climate change is not nearly as simple as causing it. Since the end of the Industrial Revolution in 1870, global carbon emissions have increased exponentially, with over 30 gigatons of CO2 released in 2013 alone. Moreover, with an effective atmospheric residence time of ~200 years, roughly a quarter of those CO2 molecules released at the end of the 19th century still contribute to climate change today! It is clear that a multifaceted approach must be taken in order to mitigate the harmful effects of climate change, and key to these efforts will be the research and development of (1) efficient, new energy conversion technologies that take advantage of abundant renewable resources, such as solar energy, (2) advanced catalytic materials with high selectivity and activity in order to make industrial processes more efficient, and (3) porous materials capable of high volume carbon capture. Organic photovoltaics (OPV) are promising "third-generation" solar cells that can be produced cheaply and scaled to large areas. In normal operating mode, OPV devices are typically structured by mixing an electron-donating polymer with electron-accepting fullerene, with this "bulk heterojunction" sandwiched between a transparent conducting anode and metal cathode. Thus, metal-organic interfaces, such as that between the electron acceptor and electron-conducting metal cathode, are critical to the performance of these devices, and while much research in the OPV field is focused on incrementally bumping up device efficiency, a deeper understanding of these systems can be gained through surface science studies of these crucial interfaces as they are prepared. Likewise, the structure-functional relationships between metal nanoparticles and metal-oxide supports is a topic of immense interest to the field of heterogeneous catalysis. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are extremely versatile materials composed of small metal or metal oxide nodes connected by organic linker groups of a fixed length and conformation, forming highly ordered, porous structures with large surface areas. Since the nodes in many MOFs are oxide clusters of controllable sizes near ~1 nm in diameter, they can be thought of as very well-defined and homogeneous oxide "nano-supports" to which catalytic metals can be attached to improve activity or simply to provide a more homogeneous and well-defined structure to facilitate fundamental studies of oxide-supported metal clusters. The organic linker groups effectively isolate these nodes (and the supported metals) from each other, thus possibly preventing sintering of the metal centers. Thus, MOFs hold great promise for applications in heterogeneous catalysis, separations, and greenhouse gas storage, and the binding of metal atoms to the oxide nodes of MOFs is a subject of considerable interest.3 aIn this dissertation, adsorption calorimetry is used in concert with surface spectroscopies in ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) to study the adsorption of calcium metal onto phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM), by far the most well-studied and prominently-used electron accepting material in OPV. Calcium metal, due to its very low work function, is commonly used as a cathode material in normal OPV devices, making the Ca/PCBM interface critically important for understanding device performance and stability. This study reveals a tendency for Ca metal to diffuse subsurface over 10 nm deep and react aggressively with subsurface methyl ester groups of PCBM to make the Ca carboxylate of PCBM. Next, a comprehensive experimental and theoretical study of Ca metal on the MOF NU-1000 is presented. NU-1000 is a particularly promising MOF for catalysis because of its water- and temperature-stability, and large porosity and surface area. Our results reveal a tendency for Ca metal to diffuse subsurface over 20 nm deep to react strongly with the hydroxyl- and H2O-terminated nodes producing Ca(OH)2 nanoparticles. This is the first study where the interaction of metal atoms with the metal-oxide cluster nodes of any MOF has been characterized in detail with respect to experimental bonding energetics, and it provides a crucial benchmark for computational models of metal bonding to the oxide nodes in MOFs. Finally, this dissertation presents the first-ever calorimetric measurements of the adsorption of precursors used in atomic layer deposition (ALD) using a specially-designed calorimeter. According to the ISI Web of Science, journal articles on the topic of ALD were cited>32,000 in the year 2015 alone, a trend which has grown exponentially since the first publication in 1981. ALD is a versatile technique for depositing uniform thin films of precision thickness with exceptional conformity to underlying substrates, even when the surfaces are extremely complex. It has been applied to a wide range of fields including semiconductors, batteries, biomaterials, photovoltaics, and catalysis, including OPVs and MOFs, making this study a perfect complement to our UHV adsorption calorimetry experiments. Unique to ALD is the sequential, self-limiting surface reactions that are separated in time by inert gas purging. We focus on the sequential reaction of trimethylaluminum and water to make Al2O3, by far the most extensively studied ALD reaction scheme and the focus of numerous review papers, which cycles between a methylated and hydroxylated surface. We show that the reaction heat of the first half-reaction is ~426 kJ/mol and that for the second half-reaction is ~187 kJ/mol (both exothermic). These measured energies will enable future computational studies to verify the nature of the surface intermediates involved in the elementary steps of this highly important ALD process to make conformal alumina films. We then extend this new ALD calorimetry technique to the formation of three other relevant oxides films by ALD--TiO2, MnO, and one other process to make Al2O3--to highlight the technique's versatility. Taken together, the work presented in this dissertation represents an attempt at deeper understanding of interfaces pertinent to the broad fields of energy conversion and carbon capture, and these results will help to guide the development of efficient new technologies, which is vitally important in order to address the global issue of climate change. The calorimetric study of Ca on PCBM is perhaps the most fundamentally significant study yet produced by our group on metal-organic interfaces, and serves as a perfect complement to the suite of studies by our group of Ca metal adsorption on organic semiconducting polymers. We also applied our UHV adsorption calorimetry technique to perform the first-ever study of metal adsorption on the nodes of any MOF, providing a benchmark for validating the energy accuracy of the computational methods used to model metal bonding to the oxide nodes in MOFs, and to oxide clusters in general. Finally, the introduction here of the first calorimeter for measuring heats of adsorption of ALD precursors has vast potential for future applications, as ALD is a uniquely capable technique with wide-ranging applicability, but very little is known about the enthalpies involved during ALD half-reactions. Moreover, the accuracy of computational methods used for calculating these energies, such as density functional theory, is not known without such experimental energies to reference.3 aThus, our calorimeter will provide valuable benchmark energies for ALD reactions on surfaces, with future applications in syntheses of a broad range of materials, such as catalysts, photovoltaics, microelectronics, sensors, biomaterials and coatings, all of broad interest to the scientific community.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed November 30, 2016). 0aCalciumxAbsorption and adsorption. 0aAdsorption calorimetry. 0aAtomic layer deposition. 0aEnergy conversion. 0aSurface chemistry. 0aMetalsxSurfaces. 7aAdsorption calorimetry.2fast0(OCoLC)fst02025602 7aAtomic layer deposition.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01909248 7aEnergy conversion.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00910026 7aMetalsxSurfaces.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01018201 7aSurface chemistry.2fast0(OCoLC)fst011392100 aAtomic layer deposition0 aCalorimetry0 aMetal-organic frameworks0 aOrganic photovoltaics0 aSurface science0 aPhysical chemistry0 aChemical engineering0 aChemistry 4aThesesxChemical engineering. 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aCampbell, Charles T.,edegree supervisor.1http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q8768742940uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/37053  aWAUW02509cam a2200421Ii 45000010011000000080041000110060019000520050017000710070014000880400070001021000033001722450090002052640063002952640011003583000066003693360026004353370026004613380036004873470021005233470008005445020048005525040055006005200872006555880097015276500021016246500026016456500012016716500047016836500052017306500038017826530025018206550033018456550047018786550028019257000088019538560037020410490009020781077480581181204t20182018waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20210721171413.1cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdOCLCFdWAUdOCLCQdOCLCOdOCLdWAUdOCLCO1 aMa, Jinrong,d1993-eauthor.10aStudy of a novel zwitterionic material and its biological applications /cJinrong Ma. 1a[Seattle] :b[University of Washington Libraries],c[2018] 4c©2018  a1 online resource (38 pages) :billustrations (chiefly color)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext file2rdaft  bPDF  bM.S.

In our efforts to prevent biofouling in various applications, we have developed a biocompatible polymer that exhibits incredible hydrophilic and nonfouling properties in a range of host systems, while boasting impressive mechanical properties and bulk stability of the coating. In this study, the mechanical properties and antifouling performances of high-strength zwitterionic hydrogel sheets and microgel coatings were studied at length. Both materials showed substantially improved antifouling effects versus polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and glass control surfaces and still presented superhydrophilic surfaces after more than 2 months in aqueous environments. In addition, fouling that does occur on our surfaces can be easily removed if light cleaning is performed at regular intervals. Consequently, these materials are viable options in many applications to negate the effects of biofouling.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed September 9, 2019). 0aFoulingxPrevention. 0aSurfaces (Technology) 0aPolyzwitterions. 0aColloids. 0aCoatings. 7aSurfaces (Technology)2fast0(OCoLC)fst01139278 7aPolyzwitterions.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01739529 7aFoulingxPrevention.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00933252 7aColloids.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00868334 7aCoatings.2fast0(OCoLC)fst008658590 aAntifouling0 aBiofouling0 aCoating0 aHydrogel0 aZwitterionic0 aChemical engineering0 aPolymer chemistry0 aBioengineering 4aThesesxChemical engineering. 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aJiang, Shaoyi,d1964-edegree supervisor.1http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q8856592040uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/44099  aWAUW02846cam a2200541Ii 45000010011000000080041000110060019000520050017000710070014000880400065001021000028001672450173001952640063003682640011004313000061004423360026005033370026005293380036005553470021005913470021006123470008006335020043006415040057006845200790007415880099015316500018016306500025016486500019016736500026016926500044017186500051017626500045018136500052018586530017019106530017019276530024019446530018019686530024019866530019020106530025020296550033020546550047020876550028021347000043021627000053022058560037022580490009022951004244176170918t20172017waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20190522011037.3cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdOCLCOdWAUdOCLCFdOCLdOCLCQdOCLCO1 aMatsen, Janet,eauthor.10aGenomics, transcriptomics, and statistical/machine learning to enhance understanding of methanotrophic microbial metabolism in isolates and communities /cJanet Matsen. 1a[Seattle] :b[University of Washington Libraries],c[2017] 4c©2017  a1 online resource (xi, 175 pages) :bcolor illustrations  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext file2rdaft  adata file2rdaft  bPDF  bPh.

The charging of colloidal particles in these apolar environments relies on the presence of surfactants and their reverse micelles. Reverse micelles can undergo disproportionation reactions with one another, resulting in bulk charges in the media and an increased system conductivity. Surfactant molecules adsorbed on particle surfaces can undergo acid-base interactions with the surface functional groups, resulting in the formation of charges. The now-charged surfactant molecule is then stabilized in a reverse micelle, leaving a net charge on the particle surface. Many factors influence the micellization and particle charging behavior of these surfactants - from environmental variables, such as temperature and humidity, to the surfactant, particle, and solvent chemistries and structures. We show that the micellization of the surfactant Aerosol OT becomes less favorable with increasing solvent dielectric constant. Surfactant chemistries can be tuned by performing simple ion-exchange reactions with the surfactant head group. We have shown that increasing the electronegativity of the cation in the head group results in more acidic surfactants, and therefore the ability to impart higher maximum charges to particle surfaces. The critical micelle concentrations (CMCs) of a surfactant series were investigated as a function of temperature, and found to increase with increasing temperature. This same series was then used to charge colloidal particles at three temperatures, which resulted in decreasing maximum particle charge with increasing temperature. The structures of these reverse micelles were investigated using small angle neutron scattering (SANS), and it was found that the core radii of the reverse micelles decreased with increasing surfactant tail length. Tri-tailed surfactants formed reverse micelles with the smallest core radii, of ~4Å. This study suggested that in order to impart the maximum charge to colloidal particles, the reverse micelles being used must have intermediate core sizes, in order to offer a large enough polar environment to stabilize charge, but not one too large such that disproportionation reactions in the bulk cause electrostatic screening of the particle charges. Applications of this research are discussed.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed March 29, 2017). 0aColloidsxElectric properties. 0aMicelles. 7aColloidsxElectric properties.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00868336 7aMicelles.2fast0(OCoLC)fst010193920 aCharging0 aColloids0 aInterfaces0 aMicelles0 aNonpolar0 aParticles0 aChemical engineering 4aThesesxChemical engineering 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aBerg, John C.,d1937-edegree supervisor.40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/38083  aWAUW05314cam a2200481Ii 45000010011000000080041000110060019000520050017000710070014000880400044001021000034001462450113001802640063002932640011003563000073003673360026004403370026004663380036004923470021005283470008005495000010005575020044005675040051006115880097006625203613007596500027043726500028043996500053044276500054044806530012045346530008045466530014045546530013045686530016045816530010045976530025046076550028046326550034046606550047046947000045047418560037047860490009048231083643898190130t20182018waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20190731191915.0cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdOCLCFdWAUdOCL1 aMurbach, Matthew D.,eauthor.10aLinear and nonlinear electrochemical impedance spectroscopy for lithium-ion batteries /cMatthew D.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is a powerful and widely used technique for noninvasively characterizing many electrochemical systems including lithium-ion batteries; however, the restriction of probing only the linearized physics artificially limits the information that can be extracted from an inherently nonlinear system. Here we describe a natural extension to EIS, called nonlinear EIS (NLEIS), which can break the degeneracy of linearization and provide complementary information to EIS. In this work, the initial theoretical and experimental groundwork for NLEIS as a powerful characterization method for lithium-ion batteries is developed. A physics-based mathematical model describing the fundamental (linear) and higher harmonic (nonlinear) response of a lithium-ion battery is used to analyze the first experimentally measured full-frequency second harmonic NLEIS spectra. Modeling results indicate that the information contained in NLEIS spectra compliments EIS characterization of charge-transfer kinetics (through the sensitivity of the second harmonic to reaction symmetry) and thermodynamic and transport processes (through a more distinct and sensitive low frequency response). Experimentally, we show that NLEIS and EIS are able to characterize early degradation (< 1% capacity loss) in commercially available (1.5 Ah LiNMC∎C) batteries. While NLEIS shows that fresh cells have high symmetry charge transfer ([alpha]a = [alpha]c = 0.5), a shift toward kinetics that favor oxidation on the positive electrode ([alpha]a,pos > 0.5, [alpha]c,pos  < 0.5) occurs as the cell is aged. Furthermore, modeling insights and experimental measurements of linear EIS and second harmonic NLEIS spectra at different states-of-charge (SoC) and states-of-health (SoH) suggest that combining EIS and NLEIS shows promise for improved battery characterization, parameter estimation, and model validation. To accelerate the adoption and reproducibility of experimental EIS and NLEIS analysis, several open software tools are also presented in this work. In particular, the Randles equivalent circuit model is extended to account for nonlinearities in charge transfer kinetics and thermodynamics to create a second harmonic NLEIS equivalent circuit. We show that EIS and NLEIS Randles circuits can be used to easily capture reaction asymmetry via the ratio of arc widths in the linear EIS and second harmonic NLEIS spectra. Analysis of experimental EIS and NLEIS measurements at different SoC for an aged, commercially available battery indicate that positive electrode charge transfer is more asymmetric at low SoCs ([alpha]a,pos[superscript]50%, SoC = 0.49, [alpha]a,pos[superscript]10%, SoC = 0.68). We also describe a web-based platform, the ImpedanceAnalyzer, for the easy-to-use estimation of physics-based parameters from experimental linear EIS spectra. We show that an a priori computed dataset can be used to quickly and robustly provide a best-matching spectrum that can be further explored with interactive visualizations or local parameter optimization. A global sensitivity analysis shows the increased sensitivity and complementary information content of second harmonic NLEIS spectra. The implications of NLEIS as a sensitive, whole-cell, in situ diagnostic for studying typically hard to detect degradation modes, such as lithium plating, are also discussed. 0aLithium ion batteries. 0aImpedance spectroscopy. 7aLithium ion batteries.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01764640 7aImpedance spectroscopy.2fast0(OCoLC)fst009680920 aBattery0 aEIS0 aImpedance0 aKinetics0 aLithium-ion0 aNLEIS0 aChemical engineering 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft 4aThesesxChemical engineering. 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst017264531 aSchwartz, Daniel T.,edegree supervisor.40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/42990  aWAUW02927cam a2200517Ii 45000010011000000080041000110060019000520050017000710070014000880400056001021000026001582450074001842640063002582640011003213000066003323360026003983370026004243380036004503470021004863470008005075020049005155040055005645200931006195880098015506500037016486500031016856500040017166500019017566500021017756500057017966500063018536500047019166500066019636500045020296530017020746530017020916530015021086530018021236530025021416550034021666550047022006550028022477000088022758560037023630490009024001117715369190909t20192019waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20210721171841.6cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdOCLCFdWAUdOCLdWAUdOCLCO1 aNiu, Liqian,eauthor.12aA study of zwitterionic polypeptide-protein conjugates /cLiqian Niu. 1a[Seattle] :b[University of Washington Libraries],c[2019] 4c©2019  a1 online resource (37 pages) :billustrations (chiefly color)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext file2rdaft  bPDF  bM.S.

Results show that this is a promising strategy to endow protein drugs with a stealth layer, allowing proteins to escape immune attack, increase half-life with no accelerated blood clearance effect, and exhibit super-low immunogenicity.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed September 9, 2019). 0aProteinsxChemical modification. 0aProteinsxTherapeutic use. 0aPolyethylene glycolxBiotechnology. 0aBioconjugates. 0aPolyzwitterions. 7aProteinsxTherapeutic use.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01079767 7aProteinsxChemical modification.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01079722 7aPolyzwitterions.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01739529 7aPolyethylene glycolxBiotechnology.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01070449 7aBioconjugates.2fast0(OCoLC)fst008319990 aAnimal study0 aBiomaterials0 aConjugates0 aProtein drugs0 aChemical engineering 4aThesesxChemical engineering. 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aJiang, Shaoyi,d1964-edegree supervisor.1http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q8856592040uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/44092  aWAUW02612cam a2200421Ii 45000010011000000080041000110060019000520050017000710070014000880400039001021000026001412450171001672640063003382640011004013000066004123360026004783370026005043380036005303470021005663470008005875020049005955040055006445201013006995880098017126500039018106530023018496530028018726530015019006530025019156530026019406530025019666550034019916550047020256550028020727000044021008560037021440490009021811117715229190909t20192019waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20191018170720.9cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdOCLCFdWAU1 aNiu, Zhiyin,eauthor.10aDevelopment of chloromethyl functionalized poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) derivative (PEDOT-MeCl:PSS) hole transport layer for perovskite solar cells /cZhiyin Niu. 1a[Seattle] :b[University of Washington Libraries],c[2019] 4c©2019  a1 online resource (42 pages) :billustrations (chiefly color)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext file2rdaft  bPDF  bM.S.

A combination of characterization techniques was employed to investigate the effects of chloromethyl function group on the electron donation capability of PEDOT-MeCl:PSS, perovskite film quality and charge recombination kinetics in the solar cells. Our study shows that the presence of chloromethyl group at the PEDOT-MeCl surface gives the HTL a desirable energy level alignment with perovskite. The favorable interaction between the chlorine and perovskite provides a better crystal with less PbI₂ comparing with PEDOT:PSS. As a result, better device performance with higher short-circuit current density (Jsc) and fill factor (FF) was gained, leading to better power conversion efficiency. Our study provides an insight to the development of new hole transport materials for high efficiency perovskite solar cells.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed September 9, 2019). 0aPerovskite solar cellsxMaterials.0 aConducting polymer0 aHole transporting layer0 aMorphology0 aPEDOT:PSS derivative0 aPerovskite solar cell0 aChemical engineering 4aThesesxChemical engineering. 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aYu, Qiuming,d1963-edegree supervisor.40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/44088  aWAUW05363cam a2200541Ii 45000010011000000080041000110060019000520050017000710070014000880400058001021000030001602450102001902460121002922640063004132640011004763000067004873360026005543370026005803380036006063470021006423470008006635020043006715040057007145203348007715880097041196500025042166500023042416500017042646500013042816500027042946500039043216500043043606500051044036500049044546530009045036530014045126530014045266530023045406530022045636530012045856530025045976550033046226550047046556550028047027000045047308560037047750490009048121077480235181204t20182018waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20190803135217.6cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdOCLCFdWAUdOCLCQdOCLCOdOCL1 aOleson, Karl R.,eauthor.10aExtractives of Douglas-fir and their implications for biofuel saccharification /cKarl R.

This biomass is the waste created from logging and forest thinning operations and consists of branches, treetops, and other unmerchantable timber. Douglas-fir residues have received special attention since Douglas-fir is the most abundant tree in the timberlands of the Western United States. Biofuel from this material has yet to hit full-scale production, but production processes are already being investigated at the pilot plant scale. Creating a biofuel industry from forestry residues is a complex challenge, and there is a need for research into secondary products and process optimization. The best way to go about finding improvements is to holistically connect the challenges observed in processing millions of tons of biomass to the molecular interactions at hand. With this in mind, this research begins by modeling a biofuel process in ASPEN to understand what molecules are present in processing. We then experimentally identify process inhibitors and explore the molecular origins of this inhibition. The specific focus of this research is on the "extractives" class of molecules in forestry residues. Extractives make up 5% to 25% of the dry weight for different tissues of Douglas-fir, but are overlooked in most biofuel studies. These molecules have been well studied in pulp and paper industry circles and this past knowledge can be used for inspiration for biofuel research. Extractives are both unconsidered secondary products and biofuel process inhibitors. This work first collates the known literature on Douglas-fir extractives into a representative chemical model of Douglas-fir forestry residues. This model is then used to predict which extractives end up in the various process streams of a simulation model of the Northwest Advanced Renewables Alliance (NARA)'s biofuel process. NARA's biofuel process relies upon a process called saccharification, and the information derived from process modelling is used to begin studying this step. Saccharification is the key step in this process and involves enzymes breaking down biomass into soluble sugars for further conversion into fuels and chemicals. This work shows these enzymes are inhibited by the "tannins" class of extractives in Douglas-fir bark. Initial glucose production from crystalline cellulose is shown to be inhibited ~40%, and specific types of enzyme are individually inhibited ~15-20%. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations were used to investigate how a characterized tannin in Douglas-fir binds onto the most abundantly produced cellulase from Trichoderma reesei, Cel7A. We find that the tannin can bind onto the cellulase and obstruct the catalytic tunnel of this enzyme in a variety of different ways with the tannin preferring to bind to sites that contain aromatic or charged amino acid residues. There is still much to learn and explore in this area. Extraction and collection of the tannins as secondary products may be the most appealing option to remove inhibition but may not be economical. Instead, bioengineered tannin resistant enzymes could be appealing, and the information presented here could provide the foundation for that work.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed December 4, 2018). 0aCoarse woody debris. 0aBiomass chemicals. 0aDouglas fir. 0aTannins. 0aCellulasexInhibitors. 7aTannins.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01142840 7aDouglas fir.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00897152 7aCoarse woody debris.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00865688 7aBiomass chemicals.2fast0(OCoLC)fst008325250 aBark0 aCellulase0 aCellulose0 aMolecular Dynamics0 aProcess Modelling0 aTannins0 aChemical engineering 4aThesesxChemical engineering 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aSchwartz, Daniel T.,edegree supervisor.40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/42221  aWAUW02734cam a2200481Ii 45000010011000000080041000110060019000520050017000710070014000880400058001021000026001602450102001862640063002882640011003513000069003623360026004313370026004573380036004833470021005193470008005405020041005485040055005895201016006445880097016606500020017576500014017776500024017916500040018156500050018556500046019056530012019516530012019636530022019756530023019976530012020206530025020326550033020576550047020906550028021377000041021658560037022060490009022431077480140181204t20182018waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20190803135215.8cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdOCLCFdWAUdOCLCQdOCLCOdOCL1 aPan, Tai-Yu,eauthor.10aAccelerating peptoid-surface simulations :bpeptoid binding on Au(111) and Au(100) /cTai-Yu Pan. 1a[Seattle] :b[University of Washington Libraries],c[2018] 4c©2018  a1 online resource (v, 25 pages) :billustrations (chiefly color)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext file2rdaft  bPDF  bM.S.cUniversity of Washingtond2018  aIncludes bibliographical references (pages 23-25).3 aIn nature, proteins and peptides are found to have specific binding on inorganic surface, especially on gold surface. However, the main challenge for synthesized proteins and peptides is their poor stability. Thus, sequence defined peptoids were found to mimic the natural behavior. F. Yan et al. recently discovered a method for designing peptoid that was able to change the morphology of the gold nanoparticles to star-shaped. However, no matter proteins, peptides or peptoids, the binding mechanism remains unknown due to difficult observation in conformational change from laboratory experiment. In our study, we used molecular dynamics simulation to investigate in atomic level for systems of peptoid on Au(111) and Au(100) surfaces, which are the most common structure for gold in nature. Combined with enhanced sampling method, we were able to obtain the binding free energy. In addition, to sample the strong binding systems, we introduced the two-step metadynamics method to accelerate the simulations.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed December 4, 2018). 0aGoldxSurfaces. 0aPeptides. 0aMolecular dynamics. 7aPeptides.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01057564 7aMolecular dynamics.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01024778 7aGoldxSurfaces.2fast0(OCoLC)fst009443980 aAu(100)0 aAu(111)0 aEnhanced sampling0 aMolecular dynamics0 aPeptoid0 aChemical engineering 4aThesesxChemical engineering 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aPfaendtner, Jim,edegree supervisor.40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/42222  aWAUW03082cam a2200493Ii 45000010011000000080041000110060019000520050017000710070014000880400065001021000028001672450087001952640063002822640011003453000062003563360026004183370026004443380036004703470021005063470008005275020043005355040057005785201237006355880092018726500032019646500027019966500053020236500058020766530030021346530035021646530043021996530026022426530033022686530033023016530011023346530016023456530025023616550033023866550047024196550028024667000048024948560037025420490009025791033544369180501t20172017waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20190501211212.4cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdOCLCOdOCLCFdWAUdOCLdOCLCQdOCLCO1 aPathak, Manan,eauthor.10aModel-based battery management systems :bfrom theory to practice /cManan Pathak. 1a[Seattle] :b[University of Washington Libraries],c[2017] 4c©2017  a1 online resource (xii, 138 pages) :bcolor illustrations  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext file2rdaft  bPDF  bPh.

Capacity and power fade, and slow recharging times are key issues that restrict its use in many applications. Battery management systems are critical to address these issues, along with ensuring its safety. This dissertation focuses on exploring various control strategies using detailed physics-based electrochemical models developed previously for lithium-ion batteries, which could be used in advanced battery management systems. Optimal charging profiles for minimizing capacity fade based on SEI-layer formation are derived and the benefits of using such control strategies are shown by experimentally testing them on a 16 Ah NMC-based pouch cell. This dissertation also explores different time-discretization strategies for non-linear models, which gives an improved order of convergence for optimal control problems. Lastly, this dissertation also explores a physics-based model for predicting the linear impedance of a battery, and develops a freeware that is extremely robust and computationally fast. Such a code could be used for estimating transport, kinetic and material properties of the battery based on the linear impedance spectra.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed May 1, 2018). 0aBattery management systems. 0aLithium ion batteries. 7aLithium ion batteries.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01764640 7aBattery management systems.2fast0(OCoLC)fst020031630 aBattery Management System0 aElectrochemical Energy Storage0 aElectrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy0 aLithium-ion Batteries0 aModel-based optimal charging0 aPseudo Two-Dimensional Model0 aEnergy0 aEngineering0 aChemical engineering 4aThesesxChemical engineering 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aSubramanian, Venkat R.,edegree supervisor.40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/40857  aWAUW03456cam a2200529Ii 45000010011000000080041000110060019000520050017000710070014000880400065001021000028001672450140001952640063003352640011003983000060004093360026004693370026004953380036005213470021005573470008005785020048005865040055006345201506006895880099021956500031022946500057023256500024023826500022024066500050024286500048024786530017025266530016025436530023025596530021025826530013026036530009026166530028026256530017026536530024026706530025026946550033027196550047027526550028027997000053028278560037028800490009029171004309321170919t20172017waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20190522000540.8cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdOCLCOdWAUdOCLCFdOCLdOCLCQdOCLCO1 aPhilip, Pearl,eauthor.10aAnalyzing small molecule inhibition of enzymes :ba preliminary machine learning approach towards drug lead generation /cPearl Philip. 1a[Seattle] :b[University of Washington Libraries],c[2017] 4c©2017  a1 online resource (ii, 53 pages) :bcolor illustrations  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext file2rdaft  bPDF  bM.S.

Molecular descriptors are calculated using PyChem and employed to characterize the properties of about 400,000 drug-like compounds from a high-throughput screening assay made available on PubChem. Multiple machine learning models are created on the training data using Scikit-learn and Theano after feature selection and processing, followed by a genetic algorithm to synthesize an ideal enzyme inhibitor to be tested for activity and use as a drug compound. Higher error and poorer model fits can be attributed to multiple sources of error - measurement of activity using AC50, imbalanced dataset in favor of molecules with zero inhibition, incomplete feature space, highly non-linear interactions between the enzyme and drug, and the attainment of local minima in hyperparameter optimization.

Molecular descriptors are calculated using PyChem and employed to characterize the properties of about 400,000 drug-like compounds from a high-throughput screening assay made available on PubChem. Multiple machine learning models are created on the training data using Scikit-learn and Theano after feature selection and processing, followed by a genetic algorithm to synthesize an ideal enzyme inhibitor to be tested for activity and use as a drug compound. Higher error and poorer model fits can be attributed to multiple sources of error - measurement of activity using AC50, imbalanced dataset in favor of molecules with zero inhibition, incomplete feature space, highly non-linear interactions between the enzyme and drug, and the attainment of local minima in hyperparameter optimization.

Previous work has investigated the surfactant mediated acid-base charging mechanisms of oxides and similar particles where it has been shown that the sign of particle charge can be determined by comparing the acid-base properties of a particle, i.e., point of zero charge (PZC), to an experimentally determined "effective pH" of a surfactant molecule. This work explores the surfactant mediated particle charging mechanisms in four new venues. First, the present work shows that clay particles, which have multiple charging mechanisms in water, can charge only via an acid-base reverse micelle charging mechanism in apolar media. While the majority of clay particle charge is derived from isomorphous substitution in water, this charging mechanism is not operable in apolar media. It is also demonstrated that the charge of clay particles can be predicted by comparing their surface acid-base properties to the acid-base properties of the surfactants used. Second, the effect that reverse micelle size and structure has on particle charging in apolar media is investigated here. Results show that the size of the reverse micelle core dictates its particle charging ability. Third, binary surfactant systems in apolar media are investigated with the objective of tuning the surfactant acid-base properties for the target particles by mixing surfactants with different effective pH values. This would allow the practitioner another method to accurately control the sign and magnitude of nanoparticle charge in apolar media. Finally, while particle charging has been studied in aqueous ([epsilon]=80) and apolar ([epsilon]=2) media, limited study has been conducted in solvents with intermediate dielectric constants, commonly referred to as leaky dielectrics, where many industrial applications of particle charging exist. The present work explores particle charging in leaky dielectrics where three charging mechanisms are identified arising from particle-solvent, particle-surfactant, and solvent-surfactant interactions. In leaky dielectrics, particles can acquire charge from the solvent as described by their donor numbers, from the adsorption of surfactant ions, and from the formation of reverse micelles which facilitate an acid-base charging mechanism.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed February 18, 2020). 0aSurface chemistry. 0aSurface active agents. 0aParticles. 0aMicelles. 0aElectric charge and distribution. 7aSurface chemistry.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01139210 7aSurface active agents.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01139197 7aParticles.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01054113 7aMicelles.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01019392 7aElectric charge and distribution.2fast0(OCoLC)fst009045260 aChemical engineering 4aThesesxChemical engineering. 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aBerg, John C.,d1937-edegree supervisor.40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/45130  aWAUW02848cam a2200493Ii 45000010011000000080041000110060019000520050017000710070014000880400044001021000030001462450157001762640063003332640011003963000072004073360026004793370026005053380036005313470021005673470008005885020044005965040057006405200930006975880095016276500030017226500041017526500017017936500024018106500056018346500067018906500050019576500043020076530017020506530026020676530012020936530028021056530025021336550028021586550034021866550047022207000041022678560037023080490009023451097199808190415t20182018waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20190803112932.1cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdOCLCFdWAUdOCL1 aPrakash, Arushi,eauthor.10aUnderstanding self-assembly in solution and at interfaces using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations and enhanced sampling methods /cArushi Prakash. 1a[Seattle] :b[University of Washington Libraries],c[2018] 4c©2018  a1 online resource (xxi, 234 pages) :billustrations (chiefly color)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext file2rdaft  bPDF  bPh.

Notable examples include, the formation of plaque during Alzheimer's disease, and the formation of protein-templates for biomineralization. Even though these assembly processes are well-studied, they remain poorly understood. The focus of this dissertation is to investigate early-stage assembly processes, including adsorption of particles on surfaces, and oligomer formation using classical molecular dynamics and enhanced sampling methods (like metadynamics and umbrella sampling). As these systems are explored, improved protocols for enhanced sampling of protein-adsorption simulations are developed to tackle the roles of ions in simulations, and to incorporate experimental data into the sampling using Bayesian inference. Further, a new sampling method is developed to make these enhanced sampling simulations more efficient.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed April 15, 2019). 0aSelf-assembly (Chemistry) 0aProteinsxAbsorption and adsorption. 0aBiopolymers. 0aMolecular dynamics. 7aSelf-assembly (Chemistry)2fast0(OCoLC)fst01111504 7aProteinsxAbsorption and adsorption.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01079712 7aMolecular dynamics.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01024778 7aBiopolymers.2fast0(OCoLC)fst008326700 aMetadynamics0 aMolecular simulations0 aProtein0 aComputational chemistry0 aChemical engineering 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft 4aThesesxChemical engineering. 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst017264531 aPfaendtner, Jim,edegree supervisor.40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/43324  aWAUW02880cam a2200469Ii 45000010011000000080041000110060019000520050017000710070014000880400044001021000024001462450079001702640063002492640011003123000070003233360026003933370026004193380036004453470021004813470008005025000010005105020044005205040055005645201155006195880098017746500048018726500037019206500063019576530021020206530021020416530031020626530017020936530025021106530027021356550034021626550047021966550028022437000048022717000045023198560037023640490009024011128832448191125t20192019waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20200711123742.5cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdOCLCFdWAUdOCL1 aQi, Yanbo,eauthor.10aModel-based graded electrode design for lithium-ion batteries /cYanbo Qi. 1a[Seattle] :b[University of Washington Libraries],c[2019] 4c©2019  a1 online resource (vi, 98 pages) :billustrations (chiefly color)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext file2rdaft  bPDF  aVita.  bPh.

However, the performance of lithium-ion batteries today still needs to be improved to fully meet the requirements of these applications. There are two ways to achieve better performance, either by modifying the chemistry to reach a revolutionary breakthrough or by optimizing the cell design to realize a series of gradual and continuous improvement. This work focuses on the latter approach. Whatever material we end up using, it is always necessary to optimize the cell design to fully utilize that material. This dissertation is focused on model-based graded electrode design using electrochemical models, and the implementation of optimization and simulation methods necessary to achieve the optimal design profiles. Design with constraints and multi-objective optimization have also been explored to provide a framework that works for a wide range of applications.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed November 25, 2019). 0aLithium ion batteriesxMathematical models. 0aElectrodesxMathematical models. 7aElectrodesxMathematical models.2fast0(OCoLC)fst009064030 aBattery modeling0 aGraded electrode0 aLithium-ion battery design0 aOptimization0 aChemical engineering0 aElectrical engineering 4aThesesxChemical engineering. 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aSubramanian, Venkat R.,edegree supervisor.1 aSchwartz, Daniel T.,edegree supervisor.40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/44738  aWAUW02569cam a2200481Ii 45000010011000000080041000110060019000520050017000710070014000880400044001021000033001462450111001792640063002902640011003533000078003643360026004423370026004683380036004943470021005303470008005515020049005595040057006085200831006655880095014966500017015916500015016086500022016236500041016456500043016866500048017296530011017776530014017886530022018026530016018246530019018406530025018596550028018846550034019126550047019467000048019938560037020410490009020781097199746190415t20182018waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20190803112918.7cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdOCLCFdWAUdOCL1 aRousidan, Saibihai,eauthor.10aExploring copper as a catalyst for supercritical fluid-based silicon nanowire growth /cSaibihai Rousidan. 1a[Seattle] :b[University of Washington Libraries],c[2018] 4c©2018  a1 online resource (iv, 47 unnumbered pages) :billustrations (some color)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext file2rdaft  bPDF  bM.S.

Herein, we report the semi-continuous supercritical fluid-solid-solid (SFSS) growth of Cu-seeded SiNWs. Homogeneous nucleation of silicon precursor is strongly influenced by the reaction temperature and has a huge impact on achieving continuous steady-state growth of SiNWs. We also demonstrate that by tuning the overall precursor concentration and precursor-to-metal seed ratio, one can suppress the homogeneous nucleation and reduce defects. In addition, we present an approach that can be adapted to integrate different materials into backbone/branch heterostructures. This strategy provides additional control over nanostructure morphology, offering a handle to explore and design nanowire-based structures for various applications.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed April 15, 2019). 0aNanosilicon. 0aNanowires. 0aCopper catalysts. 7aNanowires.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01032641 7aNanosilicon.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01744914 7aCopper catalysts.2fast0(OCoLC)fst008784470 aCopper0 aSFLS/SFSS0 aSilicon Nanowires0 aNanoscience0 aNanotechnology0 aChemical engineering 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft 4aThesesxChemical engineering. 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst017264531 aHolmberg, Vincent Carl,edegree supervisor.40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/43323  aWAUW04861cam a2200493Ii 45000010011000000080041000110060019000520050017000710070014000880400044001021000033001462450184001792640063003632640011004263000070004373360026005073370026005333380036005593470021005953470008006165020044006245040056006685202876007245880098036006500033036986500038037316500031037696500064038006500057038646500059039216530021039806530021040016530025040226530025040476530025040726530025040976550034041226550047041566550028042037000046042317000044042778560037043210490009043581141007219200218t20192019waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20200715160527.2cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdOCLCFdWAUdOCL1 aRutherford, Jay W.,eauthor.10aSource apportionment of combustion generated particulate matter air pollution using excitation emission matrix fluorescence spectroscopy and machine learning /cJay W.

PM originates from natural and anthropogenic sources such as dust from soil, combustion engines, and forest fires, among many others. PM exposure is quantified by measuring its mass concentration in air. This measurement alone does not identify the sources of PM exposure, which can inform effective mitigation strategies and allow for studying source-specific health effects. There are several options for source apportionment (e.g. GC-MS and X-ray fluorescence), but they are costly and time consuming to conduct. Alternative methods for source apportionment using low-cost techniques would be beneficial to the study of air pollution and its health effects. In this dissertation, I develop a method for source apportionment of combustion generated PM using fluorescent Excitation Emission Matrix (EEM) fluorescent spectroscopy and machine learning. First, I collected PM samples from combustion sources of concern to human health in the laboratory. I analyzed cyclohexane extracts of cigarette smoke, diesel exhaust and wood smoke by EEM fluorescent spectroscopy and using the World Health Organization's guideline for annual mean PM exposure of 10 [mirco]g/m³ as a basis of comparison I show EEM is sensitive enough to detect combustion generated PM at levels well below those of concern to human health. Next, mixtures of the same laboratory sources are analyzed using EEM. Combining measurements of the individual sources with those of mixtures, I apply several machine learning techniques and a simple linear model to perform source apportionment and identification from the mixtures and compare the results. A convolutional neural network (CNN) is found to have the best performance of all methods investigated. I describe in detail the architecture and data augmentation approach used for the CNN. Finally, the EEM-Machine Learning approach is used for source apportionment of environmental samples. Results and filter samples from an exposure assessment panel study are used for this analysis. The samples were analyzed using X-ray fluorescence and source apportionment was conducted using Positive Matrix Factorization. Filters, archived in a freezer, were extracted with cyclohexane and analyzed by EEM. The resulting EEM spectra and source contribution estimates from PMF were used as training data for the application of machine learning. A CNN with the same architecture as applied to the laboratory samples and Principal Component Regression showed similar results in predicting contributions from combustion generated PM. These methods were able to reproduce the XRF-PMF results with R² values as high as 0.84 for vegetative burning and 0.52 for traffic emissions.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed February 18, 2020). 0aAirxPollutionxMeasurement. 0aParticlesxEnvironmental aspects. 0aFluorescence spectroscopy. 7aParticlesxEnvironmental aspects.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01054118 7aFluorescence spectroscopy.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00928106 7aAirxPollutionxMeasurement.2fast0(OCoLC)fst008021270 aEEM Fluorescence0 aMachine Learning0 aSource Apportionment0 aEnvironmental health0 aChemical engineering0 aAnalytical chemistry 4aThesesxChemical engineering. 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aPosner, Jonathan Dov,edegree supervisor.1 aNovoselov, Igor V.,edegree supervisor.40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/45131  aWAUW03149cam a2200517Ii 45000010011000000080041000110060019000520050017000710070014000880400077001021000033001792450135002122640063003472640011004103000067004213360026004883370026005143380036005403470021005763470008005975020048006055040055006535201142007085880097018506500021019476500043019686500039020116500022020506500065020726500048021376500047021856500069022326530025023016530017023266530018023436530018023616530021023796530020024006530016024206550033024366550047024696550028025167000041025448560037025850490009026221077480703181204t20182018waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20210510184322.8cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdOCLCFdWAUdOCLCQdOCLCOdOCLdOCLCQdOCLCOdOCL1 aSakloth, Khushmeen,eauthor.10aSimultaneous prediction of density, viscosity and heat capacity of ionic liquids :ba deep learning approach /cKhushmeen Sakloth. 1a[Seattle] :b[University of Washington Libraries],c[2018] 4c©2018  a1 online resource (23 unnumbered pages) :bcolor illustrations  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext file2rdaft  bPDF  bM.S.

With the advent of deep learning and affordable GPU-computing, there is potential to accelerate the predictions with better accuracy. In this work, different deep neural network architectures have been designed to determine the density, viscosity and heat capacity of ionic liquids (ILs) as single task models in the Python package Keras. The features for the ILs include temperature, pressure and molecular descriptors of the cation and anion. Additionally, multi-task neural networks were designed to simultaneously predict all three properties. The root mean squared error and R-squared have been used to evaluate the various models. The performance of the best multi-task model is compared to the best single task model for each property. Viscosity, heat capacity perform better in single task and density performs better in multi-task. Overall, multi-task learning shows to be promising and can be further improved by including more properties.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed December 4, 2018). 0aIonic solutions. 0aAnalytical chemistryxData processing. 0aNeural networks (Computer science) 0aMachine learning. 7aNeural networks (Computer science)2fast0(OCoLC)fst01036260 7aMachine learning.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01004795 7aIonic solutions.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00978618 7aAnalytical chemistryxData processing.2fast0(OCoLC)fst008534630 aChemical Engineering0 aData Science0 aDeep Learning0 aIonic Liquids0 aMachine Learning0 aNeural Networks0 aMathematics 4aThesesxChemical engineering 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aPfaendtner, Jim,edegree supervisor.40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/42231  aWAUW03269cam a2200493Ii 4500001001000000008004100010006001900051005001700070007001400087040006500101100003700166245014500203264006300348264001100411300005600422336002600478337002600504338003600530347002400566502004800590504005500638520140800693588009502101650002302196650003202219650005802251650004902309653003002358653000802388653001102396653001202407653002902419653001502448653002502463653002202488653001402510655003302524655004702557655002802604700004602632700005102678856003702729049000902766990794049170622t20172017waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20190526182252.5cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdOCLCOdOCLCFdWAUdOCLdOCLCQdOCLCO1 aSalunkhe, Aditya Ashok,eauthor.14aThe use of boundary lubricants for the reduction of particle jamming in abrasive particle slurries for jet cutting /cAditya Ashok Salunkhe. 1a[Seattle] :b[University of Washington Libraries],c[2017] 4c©2017  a1 online resource (20 pages) :bcolor illustrations  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext filebPDF2rda  bM.S.

Direct pumping of abrasive slurries allows for more efficient use of the available energy of the high-pressure water, leading to faster cutting speeds, reduced cut kerf, and the potential to cut thicker materials. The development of ASJ technology requires the use of additives to create stable suspensions (against sedimentation) that are easily mixed, transported, stored, and pumped, and in particular that alleviate the problem of particle jamming in flow constrictions. This work investigates the effectiveness of surfactant boundary lubricants to increase lubricity and relieve jamming in model aqueous slurries of 50-µm diameter garnet abrasive particles. Lateral force microscopy (LFM) is used to characterize the lubricity of garnet surfaces pre-treated with cationic or neutral surfactants or functionalized with an octadecylsilane. All three treatments are found to produce significant increases in lubricity. The increases in particle surface lubricity are found to correlate with the results of macroscopic jamming tests in which garnet particle slurries are made to flow through the constriction provided by a syringe. Reductions of approximately 50% in jamming were achieved even under high particle loading conditions using the silane surface functionalization.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed (June 22, 2017). 0aWater jet cutting. 0aLubrication and lubricants. 7aLubrication and lubricants.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01003341 7aWater jet cutting.2fast0(OCoLC)fst011717750 aAbrasive Slurry Jet (ASJ)0 aCMC0 aGarnet0 aJamming0 aLateral Force Microscopy0 aSurfactant0 aChemical engineering0 aMaterials Science0 aChemistry 4aThesesxChemical engineering 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aBerg, John C.,d1937-edegree supervisor.1 aOverney, René M.,d1959-edegree supervisor.40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/38589  aWAUW02730cam a2200469Ii 45000010011000000080041000110060019000520050017000710070014000880400044001021000038001462450116001842640063003002640011003633000067003743360026004413370026004673380036004933470021005293470008005505020049005585040055006075200933006625880098015956500025016936500028017186500028017466500037017746500011018116500054018226500054018766500051019306500037019816530025020186530019020436550034020626550047020966550028021437000043021718560037022140490009022511117715026190909t20192019waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20200130213130.6cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdOCLCFdWAUdOCL1 aScavone, Rossana,d1991-eauthor.10aExpanded tunability of dynamic hydrogel stiffness using engineered photoresponsive proteins /cRossana Scavone. 1a[Seattle] :b[University of Washington Libraries],c[2019] 4c©2019  a1 online resource (ii, 25 pages) :billustrations (some color)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext file2rdaft  bPDF  bM.S.

Though several research efforts have been focused on trying to elucidate the effects of ECM-mediated cues on cell function, few in vitro platforms have been able to capture the four-dimensionality of mechanical signaling that is presented in vivo. Towards this, our group recently introduced a hydrogel platform that undergoes reversible stiffening, made possible using a fusion protein-based material crosslinker that underwent a stimuli-dependent conformational change. The protein used was LOV2-J[alpha], a species that responds to mild visible light and gives spatiotemporal control on the hydrogel stiffness. In this work, we seek to expand the mechanical tunability of these protein-polymer-based hydrogels through well-defined mutations.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed September 9, 2019). 0aProtein engineering. 0aProteinsxConformation. 0aProteinsxCrosslinking. 0aColloidsxMechanical properties. 0aLight. 7aProteinsxCrosslinking.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01079729 7aProteinsxConformation.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01079725 7aProtein engineering.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01079685 7aLight.2fast0(OCoLC)fst009984760 aChemical engineering0 aBioengineering 4aThesesxChemical engineering. 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aDeForest, Cole A.,edegree supervisor.40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/44087  aWAUW03202cam a2200517Ii 45000010011000000080041000110060019000520050017000710070014000880400044001021000029001462450135001752640063003102640011003733000068003843360026004523370026004783380036005043470021005403470008005615000010005695020044005795040041006235201348006645880098020126500037021106500026021476500063021736500052022366530017022886530011023056530013023166530019023296530020023486530025023686530019023936530027024126530022024396530025024616550034024866550047025206550028025677000043025958560037026380490009026751117715651190909t20192019waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20200130213235.9cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdOCLCFdWAUdOCL1 aShadish, Jared,eauthor.10aExploiting chemoenzymatic and photochemical reactions to control 4D protein presentation in cell-laden hydrogels /cJared Shadish. 1a[Seattle] :b[University of Washington Libraries],c[2019] 4c©2019  a1 online resource (ix, 202 pages) :billustrations (some color)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext file2rdaft  bPDF  aVita.  bPh.

This thesis exploits recently developed chemoenzymatic strategies to tether biomacromolecules reversibly and site-specifically to hydrogel biomaterials, an approach that uniquely preserves their full bioactivity. First, the versatile Staphylococcus aureus enzyme Sortase A was employed to generate a diverse library of homogenous, singly functionalized fluorescent proteins, enzymes, and growth factors with bioorthogonal reactive handles for biomaterial modification. Additionally, N-myristoyltranferase was used in combination with an engineered photocleavable protein (PhoCl) to create photoreleasable protein chimeras. Photolithographic patterning of these protein constructs was used to pattern dynamic biological response within 3D materials for the first time with subcellular resolution. The techniques presented here enable the creation of next-generation biomaterials that fully utilize the power and versatility of full-length proteins to probe and direct cell function in 4D.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed September 9, 2019). 0aProteinsxChemical modification. 0aBiomedical materials. 7aProteinsxChemical modification.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01079722 7aBiomedical materials.2fast0(OCoLC)fst008325860 aCell Culture0 aEnzyme0 aHydrogel0 aPhotochemistry0 aPhotopatterning0 aProtein Modification0 aBioengineering0 aBiomedical engineering0 aMaterials Science0 aChemical engineering 4aThesesxChemical engineering. 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aDeForest, Cole A.,edegree supervisor.40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/44096  aWAUW03902cam a2200517Ii 4500001001000000008004100010006001900051005001700070007001400087040007700101100004900178245014400227264006300371264001100434300006200445336002600507337002600533338003600559347001900595347000800614500001000622502004300632504005500675520193700730588009502667650002102762650002602783650003602809650003802845650005202883650004702935653001902982653001303001653001903014653001703033653001703050653002503067653002703092653002203119655003403141655004703175655002803222700008803250856003703338049000903375981492104170405t20162016waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20210721171248.5cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdOCLCOdOCLCFdWAUdOCLdOCLCQdOCLCOdWAUdOCLCO1 aSinclair, Andrewq(Andrew William),eauthor.10aBiocompatible zwitterionic polymer chemistries and hydrogels for gene therapy, drug delivery, and regenerative medicine /cAndrew Sinclair. 1a[Seattle] :b[University of Washington Libraries],c[2016] 4c©2016  a1 online resource (viii, 90 pages) :bcolor illustrations  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext file2rda  bPDF  aVita.  bPh.

In particular, polycarboxybetaine (PCB) is easy to functionalize, highly resistant to nonspecific cell and protein interactions, and able to evade immunological responses in the body. The work described in this dissertation uses several strategies to add new functionality to PCB-based materials; specifically, it strives for simple and elegant approaches to engineer the chemical and material properties of PCB-based polymers and hydrogels toward clinical applications. First, PCB-ester side chain chemistries were tailored to engineer a nontoxic gene delivery platform, based on optimized pH buffering during gene trafficking and cationic-to-zwitterionic charge switching through hydrolytic and photolabile groups. Next, step-growth polymerization strategies were investigated to design a new class of heterodifunctional "linear" PCB architectures featuring zwitterionic groups positioned directly along the polymer backbone; these polymers are promising candidates to reduce immunogenicity and extend the circulation time of biologics. Then, new physical and chemical crosslinking strategies were explored to expand the capabilities of PCB hydrogels. In one approach, bioorthogonal thiol chemistries were combined with star-shaped PCB architectures to facilitate cytocompatible stem cell encapsulation and robust ex vivo expansion. Finally, a versatile strategy was developed to give PCB hydrogels dynamic viscoelasticity. These "zwitterionic injectable pellet" (ZIP) hydrogels exhibit tunable shear-thinning and self-healing attributes, are simple to make and use at any scale, and can be sterilized, lyophilized, and reconstituted into custom injectable drug formulations and cell-protective materials.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed March 29, 2017). 0aPolyzwitterions. 0aBiomedical materials. 0aGenetic engineeringxMaterials. 0aDrug delivery devicesxMaterials. 7aBiomedical materials.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00832586 7aPolyzwitterions.2fast0(OCoLC)fst017395290 aCarboxybetaine0 aHydrogel0 aImmunotheraphy0 aNanomedicine0 aZwitterionic0 aChemical engineering0 aBiomedical engineering0 aPolymer chemistry 4aThesesxChemical engineering. 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aJiang, Shaoyi,d1964-edegree supervisor.1http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q8856592040uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/38080  aWAUW03219cam a2200517Ii 45000010011000000080041000110060019000520050017000710070014000880400056001021000031001582450123001892640063003122640011003753000070003863360026004563370026004823380036005083470021005443470008005655020044005735040055006175201299006725880098019716500034020696500022021036500024021256500050021496500048021996530017022476530018022646530021022826530023023036530018023266530016023446530015023606530017023756530025023926550034024176550047024516550028024987000041025267000088025678560037026550490009026921117715633190909t20192019waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20210721172245.0cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdOCLCFdWAUdOCLdWAUdOCLCO1 aSmith, Joshua K.,eauthor.10aCoupling molecular dynamics and machine learning to accelerate the design of bioinspired materials /cJoshua K.

Following the paradigm of bioinspired materials design, scientists and engineers aim to understand the rules of natural selectivity and to design materials that can achieve specific functions in complex biological environments without unintended consequences. Knowledge transfer from natural to synthetic design is limited by our understanding of specific and nonspecific interactions in nature at the molecular scale. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations provide a means to study biophysical systems with atomistic detail. Machine learning (ML) techniques provide a means to synthesize meaningful insights from the deluge of high-dimensional data generated by MD. In this dissertation, I explore a range of important biophysical phenomena with MD and ML, yielding insights with unprecedented resolution and interpretability.

Here, we describe the use and optimization of SBP usage in two important technological applications: the affinity purification of proteins, and the construction of a new class of bionanoelectronic devices. First, we use Car9, a silica binding peptide whose interaction with silica can be disrupted with lysine, to optimize the conditions for the purification of Car9-tagged proteins using underivatize silica. We demonstrate that capture of Car9 fusion proteins is enhanced on small particle and large pore size silica gels, that addition of 0.3% Tween 20 prevents non-specific protein binding and that efficient elution is achieved under alkaline conditions. Using the optimized conditions, we developed a small-scale purification kit that allows the inexpensive recovery of milligram-quantities of Car9-tagged proteins with purities higher than 90%. Then, we extended the functionality of SBPs to the integration of rhodopsins to electronic devices for the light activated conversion of protonic currents into electronic currents. To this end we fused Pd4, a Pd-binding peptide, to the N-terminus of the green light absorbing H.turkmenica deltarhodopsin (HtdR) to bring the protein and protons transported by it to a closer proximity to the surface of Pd/PdHx-based devices. We demonstrate that addition of the Pd4 tag leads to a nearly one order of magnitude increase in electronic signal when compared to untagged protein. To enhance their functionality and develop multi-wavelength devices, we optimized the production of a blue absorbing proteorhodopsin (BPR) by exploring signal sequence requirements and export pathway. We show that BPR does not rely on the Sec pathway for inner membrane integration and that its signal sequence is not necessary to obtain a functional product. We also identified a mutation in the signal peptidase I recognition site that prevents cleavage of the signal sequence resulting in a product that exhibits all functional attributes of the wild type protein but produced at higher levels. After optimizing the production of BPR, we constructed a Pd binding BPR to fabricate HtdR- and BPR-based devices with light absorption maxima - and consequently photocurrent maxima - separated by 37 nm. These devices exhibit wavelength-dependent photocurrent production, opening up the possibility to develop a new type of biological camera. Together, this work demonstrates that SBPs are powerful tools for the development of cost effective purification schemes and more efficient devices.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed April 15, 2019). 0aPeptidesxMetabolism. 0aProteinsxChemical modification. 0aProteinsxPurification. 0aInorganic compoundsxSurfaces. 0aPhotoreceptors. 7aProteinsxPurification.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01079750 7aProteinsxChemical modification.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01079722 7aPhotoreceptors.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01062096 7aPeptidesxMetabolism.2fast0(OCoLC)fst010575690 aChemical engineering 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft 4aThesesxChemical engineering. 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst017264531 aBaneyx, François,edegree supervisor.40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/43321  aWAUW04119cam a2200529Ii 45000010011000000080041000110060019000520050017000710070014000880400065001021000033001672450142002002640063003422640011004053000057004163360026004733370026004993380036005253470021005613470008005825020043005905040057006335202008006905880097026986500052027956500045028476500021028926500041029136500018029546500078029726500067030506500071031176500047031886500044032356530015032796530017032946530018033116530017033296530023033466530025033696550033033946550047034276550028034747000041035028560037035430490009035801014345295171208t20172017waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20190429175849.5cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdOCLCOdOCLCFdWAUdOCLdOCLCQdOCLCO1 aSprenger, Kayla G.,eauthor.10aDevelopment and use of molecular simulation tools to study the structure and function of biomolecules at interfaces /cKayla G.

Our ability to (experimentally) probe interfacial interactions between a surface, polymer, or solvent and a biomolecule has increased due to high-resolution NMR and other spectroscopic techniques. However, new structural and mechanistic insights coming from experiments alone have been limited due to - in the case of the protein/liquid interface - the compounding challenges of simultaneously studying the protein/host interface and elucidating sequence specific interactions, and in the case of the protein/surface interface - the lack of a single unifying technique that can fully resolve the structure of an adsorbed protein. For the protein/liquid interface, the challenge is even worse in the case of synthetic frameworks such as ionic liquids (ILs) where the combinatorial design space of the solvent and protein sequence explodes beyond what could ever be feasibly considered in a laboratory. The field could be greatly advanced through the use of predictive, physics-based simulations; however, best practices of how to simulate protein interfacial adsorption and extract meaningful information about protein/host interactions from molecular simulations for direct experimental comparison, are still developing. Herein, we aim to address these challenges through the use of a variety of statistical enhanced sampling simulation techniques and novel analytical approaches. A number of systems are simulated, ranging from small model proteins adsorbing onto solid, idealized surfaces, to simulations of full proteins in complex solution environments. Ultimately, these simulations should lead to large improvements in the way we use computers to study multifaceted interfacial processes like protein adsorption, in addition to providing new fundamental insights into protein/host interactions.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed December 8, 2017). 0aStructure-activity relationships (Biochemistry) 0aMolecular dynamicsxComputer simulation. 0aIonic solutions. 0aProteinsxAbsorption and adsorption. 0aBiocatalysis. 7aStructure-activity relationships (Biochemistry)2fast0(OCoLC)fst01135737 7aProteinsxAbsorption and adsorption.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01079712 7aMolecular dynamicsxComputer simulation.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01024779 7aIonic solutions.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00978618 7aBiocatalysis.2fast0(OCoLC)fst018965710 aAdsorption0 aBiocatalysis0 aIonic Liquids0 aMetadynamics0 aMolecular Dynamics0 aChemical engineering 4aThesesxChemical engineering 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aPfaendtner, Jim,edegree supervisor.40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/40509  aWAUW06319cam a2200505Ii 4500001001000000008004100010006001900051005001700070007001400087040007700101100003100178245010400209264006300313264001100376300006300387336002600450337002600476338003600502347001900538347000800557502004300565504005700608520442200665588009505087650003105182650003605213650001605249650004205265650006205307650005705369653001705426653001405443653001505457653000905472653000805481653001205489653002505501655003405526655004705560655002805607700008805635700004405723856003705767049000905804981496239170405t20162016waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20210721171424.2cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdOCLCOdOCLCFdWAUdOCLdOCLCQdOCLCOdWAUdOCLCO1 aSun, Fang,d1988-eauthor.10aDeveloping multifunctional surface chemistry for plasmonic biosensing in complex media /cFang Sun. 1a[Seattle] :b[University of Washington Libraries],c[2016] 4c©2016  a1 online resource (xiii, 168 pages) :bcolor illustrations  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext file2rda  bPDF  bPh.

Two of the most widely used and studied plasmonic sensors are surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) sensors and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensors, which are focused in this dissertation. SERS is a phenomenon which can significantly magnify the Raman signals of the molecules adsorbed on a nanostructured metal surface for up to millions of folds and have led to the detections of single molecules. SERS can also provide chemical fingerprints representing vibrational or rotational transitions specific to the molecular structure to identify the analyte. The SPR optical sensor can enable the direct observation of molecular interaction in real-time and offer the benefits of rapid, sensitive and label-free detection of chemical and biological species. Based on these advantages such as ultra-sensitivity and molecular specificity, both of the sensors have already been used for a variety of applications ranging from chemical and biological sensing, environmental monitoring to diagnostics. However, reliable biosensing in complex biological media based on these two advanced plasmonic sensors is still very challenging due to several reasons. For example, SERS is a near-field effect; the enhancement effect decreases exponentially with increasing distance from the surface. A bare SERS-active surface lacks selectivity; anything adsorbed onto the surface can be detected. In the complex media, the background noise from interfering species could mask the signals from target analytes. In addition, nonspecific adsorption from the complex media could impede the adsorption of target analytes to SERS-active substrate surfaces. Thus, a method which can amplify the detection signals over unwanted background is highly desirable and it is also essential to introduce nonfouling modifications to protect the SERS-active surface from nonspecific adsorption. For an SPR sensor, the specificity of the SPR sensor is totally dependent on the biomolecular recognition species employed while the sensitivity depends on the amount of nonspecific binding. Thereby, the surface chemistry which can not only effectively resist nonspecific protein adsorption but also provides abundant sites for the ligand immobilization is desired. In this dissertation, we discuss the design and selection of probe molecules on the SERS surface for specific detection and signal amplification of target analytes with small Raman activity or no activity such as fructose or hydrogen ion. In addition, to overcome the protein fouling problem, we introduce a zwitterionic nonfouling surface modification to the SERS sensor. We design and synthesize a zwitterionic short thiol, which contains a carboxybetaine head group resisting the protein adsorption effectively. The CBT possesses a small Raman activity generating negligible background noise even with high packing density. To future improve the nonfouling property of the modification, we also introduce the zwitterionic poly(carboxybetaine acrylamide) (pCBAA) polymer brush on the SERS surface via surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization (SI-ATRP). This modification enables the SERS detection of several therapeutic drugs directly in the human undiluted plasma. For the SPR sensor, we develop a facile and stable nonfouling coating method based on the zwitterionic hydrogel. The hydrogel coating demonstrate ultra-low fouling property from the undiluted blood serum and high antibody loading capacity due to the three-dimensional structure. At last, we also propose a new method to detect the anti-PEG antibody in blood sample based on the PEG coated SPR sensor. The surface chemistry is studied and optimized to achieve an extremely low limit of detection showing better sensitivity compared with traditional ELISA detection methods. By tailoring and tuning the surface chemistry, we explore and expand the applications of the plasmonic sensor in complex media. On the one hand, we introduce the attracting and probing molecules to enhance the detection signals. And on the other hand, we modify the zwitterionic nonfouling materials on the surface of sensors to decrease the background noise and interference. With the improved signal/noise ratio, the sensitivity of sensors can be dramatically increased.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed March 31, 2017). 0aSurface plasmon resonance. 0aRaman effect, Surface enhanced. 0aBiosensors. 7aBiosensors.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00832703 7aRaman effect, Surface enhanced.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01089673 7aSurface plasmon resonance.2fast0(OCoLC)fst011392310 aBiomaterials0 aBiosensor0 aNonfouling0 aSERS0 aSPR0 aZwitter0 aChemical engineering 4aThesesxChemical engineering. 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aJiang, Shaoyi,d1964-edegree supervisor.1http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q885659201 aYu, Qiuming,d1963-edegree supervisor.40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/38084  aWAUW03002cam a2200481Ii 4500001001000000008004100010006001900051005001700070007001400087040006000101100004300161245015200204264006300356264001100419300007100430336002600501337002600527338003600553347002400589502004300613504005600656520110700712588009201819650002501911650001801936650002701954650001801981650002201999650004802021650004402069650005102113650004402164650005302208653001902261653002402280653001702304655003402321655004702355655002802402700004402430856003702474049000902511949855126160516t20162016waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20190608031137.1cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdOCLCFdWAUdOCLCAdOCLCQdOCLCO1 aSwift, Brian James Fullerton,eauthor.10aEngineering solid binding proteins for the biofabrication of environmentally friendly multi-functional quantum dots /cBrian James Fullerton Swift. 1a[Seattle] :b[University of Washington Libraries],c[2016] 4c©2016  a1 online resource (ix, 105 pages) :billustrations (chiefly color)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext filebPDF2rda  bPh.

In this work, we design and engineer solid-binding proteins that drive the formation and assembly of multi-functional nanomaterials. We first describe a method to biomineralize Mn-doped ZnS immuno-quantum dots with a minimized protein and study how such protein-coated nanocrystals are taken up by, and impact the physiology of the model bacterium Escherichia coli. We next design and build ZnS-binding derivatives of Green Fluorescent Protein to mineralize nanocrystals that combine inorganic and organic fluorescence properties and combine these with DNA aptamers and silica phases to create small-molecule sensors. Finally, we demonstrate that solid-binding proteins can be used to solubilize carbon nanotubes and to selectively label their ends. Collectively, our results emphasize the power of protein engineering for the environmentally friendly synthesis of functional nanomaterials.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed May 2, 2016). 0aProtein engineering. 0aQuantum dots. 0aZinc sulfide crystals. 0aNanocrystals. 0aCarbon nanotubes. 7aCarbon nanotubes.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01896549 7aNanocrystals.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01032622 7aProtein engineering.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01079685 7aQuantum dots.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01085097 7aZinc sulfide crystals.2fast0(OCoLC)fst017214950 aBiofabrication0 aProtein engineering0 aQuantum dots 4aThesesxChemical engineering. 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aBaneyx, François,edegree supervisor.40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/35548  aWAUW02955cam a2200505Ii 45000010011000000080041000110060019000520050017000710070014000880400044001021000048001462450096001942640063002902640011003533000069003643360026004333370026004593380036004853470021005213470008005425020049005505040055005995201057006545880095017116500041018066500033018476500030018806500024019106500048019346500056019826500050020386530017020886530018021056530026021236530010021496530021021596530025021806550041022056550028022466550034022746550047023087000048023558560037024030490009024401097200206190415t20182018waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20190803113007.2cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdOCLCFdWAUdOCL1 aThompson, Nicole L.q(Nicole Lee),eauthor.10aTotal differential capacity plot analysis using data science methods /cNicole L.

Due to the difficulty in analyzing these datasets in their entirety, arbitrarily chosen subsets of cycles are typically reported in the literature and used to draw qualitative conclusions describing the electrochemical changes that drive the peak shifts. Herein, open-source software we developed to quantitatively analyze entire cycling datasets is discussed. Peak features, such as peak locations and areas, are extracted by individually fitting each of the differential capacity plots. We implemented a database that allows users to perform this analysis, save model fits, and return to their data at a later point. Further, we demonstrate the ability to differentiate between two battery chemistries using peak characteristics and a support vector classifier, with an accuracy of 77%. This work provides the framework for more in-depth, quantitative analyses of differential capacity data.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed April 15, 2019). 0aElectrochemistryxComputer programs. 0aElectrochemistryxDatabases. 0aElectrochemical analysis. 0aElectric batteries. 7aElectrochemistry.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00906371 7aElectrochemical analysis.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00906359 7aElectric batteries.2fast0(OCoLC)fst009044590 aData science0 aDeconvolution0 aDifferential capacity0 aDq/dv0 aElectrochemistry0 aChemical engineering 7aDatabases.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01411643 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft 4aThesesxChemical engineering. 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst017264531 aHolmberg, Vincent Carl,edegree supervisor.40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/43319  aWAUW02860cam a2200421Ii 4500001001000000008004100010006001900051005001700070007001400087040006000101100002800161245012600189264006300315264001100378300007800389336002600467337002600493338003600519347002400555502004800579504006600627520117500693588009201868650004901960650004902009650002402058650002102082650004702103650005002150653002302200653001902223655003402242655004702276655002802323700004102351856003702392049000902429949855070160516t20162016waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20190608031153.8cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdOCLCFdWAUdOCLCAdOCLCQdOCLCO1 aTung, Hsin-Ju,eauthor.10aAccelerating protein unfolding simulations :beffect of ionic liquids on villin headpiece unfolding time /cHsin-Ju Tung. 1a[Seattle] :b[University of Washington Libraries],c[2016] 4c©2016  a1 online resource (ix, 29 unnumbered pages) :billustrations (some color)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext filebPDF2rda  bM.S.

The accelerated simulation time can be 200 ~ 700 times faster than normal molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Using protein villin headpiece (HP35) as an example, we are the first to this approach to systematically investigate the effect of ionic liquids (ILs) on protein unfolding time. We reveal HP35 unfolding time in four different 20 % (w/w) ILs / water mixtures. Comparing to experimental results of ribonuclease A (RNase A), we find the anion's ability to decrease protein unfolding time shares the same order as our simulation results. A detailed examination of protein and solvent behavior at molecular-level supports the current view in the literature about protein stability in ILs; namely that the ion-protein interaction play a more significant role than the ion-induced change in the bulk water structure. This study provides the understanding of effects of ILs on protein stability and makes the achievement of calculating protein unfolding times in a greatly accelerated timescale.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed May 2, 2016). 0aProteinsxDenaturationxMathematical models. 0aProteinsxDenaturationxComputer simulation. 0aMolecular dynamics. 0aIonic solutions. 7aIonic solutions.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00978618 7aMolecular dynamics.2fast0(OCoLC)fst010247780 aMolecular dynamics0 aProtein unfold 4aThesesxChemical engineering. 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aPfaendtner, Jim,edegree supervisor.40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/35547  aWAUW02464cam a2200397Ii 45000010011000000080041000110060019000520050017000710070014000880400044001021000031001462450086001772640063002632640011003263000069003373360026004063370026004323380036004583470021004943470008005155020049005235040055005725200937006275880098015646500044016626500032017066500037017386500063017756530025018386550034018636550047018976550028019447000048019728560037020200490009020571117715372190909t20192019waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20200115191659.2cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdOCLCFdWAUdOCL1 aUppaluri, Maitri,eauthor.10aPower hardware in the loop (PHIL) simulation of battery packs /cMaitri Uppaluri. 1a[Seattle] :b[University of Washington Libraries],c[2019] 4c©2019  a1 online resource (v, 41 pages) :billustrations (chiefly color)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext file2rdaft  bPDF  bM.S.

To improve battery designs and battery management systems, PHIL simulations can be used to test their response under dynamic load conditions. The response from the load in connection to the battery model can be sent back to the model as feedback. It provides a novel approach to designing and testing new configurations of batteries from data of a single cell without building their real prototypes. An equivalent circuit model and a physics-based model of batteries were developed in SIMULINK and tested for PHIL implementation using the OPAL-RT.

In AOBs, the discharge process involves the formation of superoxides or peroxides, while charge involves oxygen evolution from discharge deposits. However, the discharge deposits are electronically insulating, requiring high overpotentials that can cause electrolyte degradation and limit battery cyclability. As a consequence, there has been significant interest in understanding battery chemistry to improve battery performance. Most studies have focused on battery cathodes, however, and the complexity of such systems makes it difficult to gain fundamental understanding of the system. In this work, several experimental frameworks are described to characterize alkali metal-O₂ chemistry. First, an attempt to use field ionization to describe battery chemistry is described. Field ionization experiments can provide a controlled environment that can provide fundamental, semi-quantitative information about reactions such as intermediates, relative rates of formation, and location of active reaction sties. Other areas of fundamental research that can provide key information for AOBs and other technologies related to metal-O₂ chemistry are defined. These include solvation characterization, parasitic chemistry studies, side product charge characterization, and catalyst exploration. In addition, a series of fundamental experiments are proposed to understand phenomena such as the initial stages of discharge and charge, electrolyte solvent reactions with discharge deposits, and spatial distribution of discharge products within discharge deposits. The concept of key states for battery chemistry characterization is described, where a key state is defined as a region where the charge/discharge curve changes behavior such as plateaus or inflection points. Finally, several case studies are presented to show the application of key states to describe battery phenomena such as cell death and transitions between stages of a charge/discharge profile.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed April 15, 2019). 0aStorage batteries. 0aAlkali metals. 0aOxygen. 7aStorage batteries.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01133980 7aOxygen.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01049616 7aAlkali metals.2fast0(OCoLC)fst008053740 aAlkali metal-O₂0 aBattery0 aCharacterization0 aField emitter0 aChemical engineering0 aEnergy 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft 4aThesesxChemical engineering. 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst017264531 aStuve, Eric Michael,edegree supervisor.1 aAdler, Stuart Blake,edegree supervisor.40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/43322  aWAUW03595cam a2200433Ii 45000010011000000080041000110060019000520050017000710070014000880400065001021000039001672450085002062640063002912640011003543000056003653360026004213370026004473380036004733470021005093470008005305020048005385040055005865880099006415202030007406500043027706500022028136500048028356530015028836530012028986530011029106530015029216530025029366550033029616550047029946550028030417000046030698560037031150490009031521004309340170919t20172017waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20190522000538.3cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdOCLCOdWAUdOCLCFdOCLdOCLCQdOCLCO1 aVenkatanarayanan, Vineet,eauthor.10aSuppression of asphaltene adsorption in porous media /cVineet Venkatanarayanan. 1a[Seattle] :b[University of Washington Libraries],c[2017] 4c©2017  a1 online resource (33 pages) :bcolor illustrations  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext file2rdaft  bPDF  bM.S.

It also explores the strategies to reduce or prevent the adsorption/deposition. Asphaltenes are highly aromatic and heavy fractions present in crude oil. Their adsorption or deposition causes problems during production due to clogging of the pore structure of the rock as well as subsequently fouling downstream piping and fittings. The porous medium used in this study is 140 mesh silica (100 micron) packed into an HPLC (high performance liquid chromatograph) column through which dilute solutions of asphaltenes in a weak solvent (toluene and tetradecane 50 % by wt.) are pumped. Langmuir isotherms fit well to the adsorption results. Saturation asphaltene adsorption ([Gamma] max) of about 1250 mg/m² is obtained for silica particles. To reduce or prevent such deposition, silica surface is modified using HTAB (hexadecyl trimethylammonium bromide), HMDS (Hexamethyldisiloxane) and OTS (Octadecyltrichlorosilane) to form a protective layer. Subsequent HPLC studies indicate that the saturation asphaltene adsorption on the treated silica has been reduced to 909.10 mg/m², 833.33 mg/m² and 588.23 mg/m² respectively. To investigate the effects of adsorption/deposition on the porosity of the silica column, dilute solution of a high molecular weight asphaltene mimic, SEPTON 4099, in a similar solvent is pumped through the column under high pressure. Adsorption/deposition is monitored by changes in the pressure required to sustain a given flow rate, which is analyzed to give the resulting change in bed porosity, as deduced using Ergun analysis. Adlayer of thickness up to 3.6 [mu] m is found to develop over a period of 60 hours. To reduce or prevent such deposition, the silica is pre-treated with HTAB to form a protective layer. Subsequent HPLC studies indicate that the polymer adsorption on the treated silica has been reduced to less than 50%. 0aAsphaltenexAbsorption and adsorption. 0aSilicaxSurfaces. 7aSilicaxSurfaces.2fast0(OCoLC)fst011185950 aAsphaltene0 aSilanes0 aSilica0 aSurfactant0 aChemical engineering 4aThesesxChemical engineering 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aBerg, John C.,d1937-edegree supervisor.40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/39978  aWAUW03518cam a2200505Ii 45000010011000000080041000110060019000520050017000710070014000880400072001021000036001742450145002102640063003552640011004183000063004293360026004923370026005183380036005443470021005803470008006015020043006095040055006525201559007075880093022666500030023596500020023896500030024096500033024396500056024726500045025286500056025736500058026296530011026876530020026986530015027186530022027336530019027556530025027746550033027996550047028326550028028797000059029078560037029660490009030031043359878180706t20182018waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20190504103332.3cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdOCLCOdOCLCFdWAUdOCLCOdOCLdOCLCQdOCLCO1 aVoje, William E.,cJr,eauthor.10aDesign of gRNA expression systems and characterization of CRISPR transcriptional networks in Saccharomyces cerevisiae /cWilliam E.

These processes are mediated by a network of bio-molecules that regulate each others' activity and expression. The sophistication of these natural systems make them intractable to recapitulate, let alone fully understand. An engineerable platform for the creation of predictable in vivo regulatory networks would make it significantly easier to access the potential biology has for human health, chemical manufacturing, and biosensing. This thesis discusses advances in engineering interconnected regulatory gene networks in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These networks employ a version of CRISPR/Cas9, isolated from Streptococcus pyogenes, that has been optimized for transcriptional repression. This work develops a modular genetic unit composed of an engineered gRNA responsive promoters and a computationally designed gRNA expression platform. This thesis first discusses the computational methods used for RNA design. Then, how the CRISPR/Cas9 platform is used to build large networks composed of upwards of seven gRNA interactions. Finally, this work details how the platform was used to quantitatively characterize CRISPR/Cas9 systems, gRNA expression platforms, and to develop a novel ligand sensitive gRNA expression platform. The advances and insights gained in this work have impacts in transcriptional network design, Pol II gRNA expression and multi-gRNA CRISPR applications.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed July 6, 2018). 0aGene regulatory networks. 0aNon-coding RNA. 0aSaccharomyces cerevisiae. 0aCRISPR-associated protein 9. 7aSaccharomyces cerevisiae.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01103039 7aNon-coding RNA2fast0(OCoLC)fst01741020 7aGene regulatory networks.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01893891 7aCRISPR-associated protein 92fast0(OCoLC)fst020005370 aCRISPR0 aGene Regulation0 aRNA design0 aSynthetic Biology0 aBioengineering0 aChemical engineering 4aThesesxChemical engineering 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aCarothers, Jamesq(James Matthew),edegree supervisor.40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/41747  aWAUW02999cam a2200397Ii 45000010011000000080041000110060019000520050017000710070014000880400044001021000028001462450107001742640063002812640011003443000063003553360026004183370026004443380036004703470021005063470008005275020049005355040055005845201457006395880098020966500039021946500022022336500065022556500048023206530025023686550034023936550047024276550028024747000053025028560037025550490009025921117715861190909t20192019waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20200130213324.9cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdOCLCFdWAUdOCL1 aWang, Yuening,eauthor.12aA generalized framework for machine re-learning of complex process and kinetic models /cYuening Wang. 1a[Seattle] :b[University of Washington Libraries],c[2019] 4c©2019  a1 online resource (24 pages) :billustrations (some color)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext file2rdaft  bPDF  bM.S.

However, since they usually characterize real system by using complicated mathematical equations, it could be very time-consuming and expensive to run them on the computer. To tackle this problem, artificial neural network (ANN) model, in many cases, has turned out to be successful surrogate model to reduce the computational burden and generate data in faster manner. However, though there is plenty of software available to create neural network, it still takes time to determine every detail for a good model. Therefore, this study was motivated to build a Python module which builds a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural network and searches the best model architecture to substitute a numerical simulation model. A synthetic data has been utilized to prototype the module. After every function works out with synthetic data, data from Pseudo-two-dimensional (P2D) battery model has been employed to test the functionality of the module. However, the best prediction gained from over 2000 models trained gives R² as only 0.3245. There are several possible causes of not finding a useable model, which could be improper processing of data, unsuitable choices of activation functions, not enough iterations went through,inappropriate optimization method, etc. The module thus needs more work to be perfected.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed September 9, 2019). 0aNeural networks (Computer science) 0aMachine learning. 7aNeural networks (Computer science)2fast0(OCoLC)fst01036260 7aMachine learning.2fast0(OCoLC)fst010047950 aChemical engineering 4aThesesxChemical engineering. 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aBeck, David Andrew Crawford,edegree supervisor.40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/44101  aWAUW02557cam a2200433Ii 45000010011000000080041000110060019000520050017000710070014000880400058001021000027001602450095001872640063002822640011003453000067003563360026004233370026004493380036004753470021005113470008005325020048005405040055005885200965006435880097016086500031017056500034017366500060017706530022018306530015018526530025018676530012018926530025019046550033019296550047019626550028020097000040020378560037020770490009021141077480516181204t20182018waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20190713032646.0cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdOCLCFdWAUdOCLCQdOCLCOdOCL1 aWei, Canfeng,eauthor.10aMaking ceramic membranes used in redox flow batteries with sol-gel process /cCanfeng Wei. 1a[Seattle] :b[University of Washington Libraries],c[2018] 4c©2018  a1 online resource (vi, 37 pages) :billustrations (some color)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext file2rdaft  bPDF  bM.S.

Redox flow batteries (RFBs) are promising batteries. However, the high cost of electrolytes and membranes impede the application of RFBs. It is worth exploring a new membrane with inexpensive material and simple process. The goals of this project are to explore a new anion exchange membrane using sol-gel process and to find the ceramic materials can be used as the membrane materials of alkaline-based organic RFBs. The membranes were prepared by coating silica paper with titania. After sintering, titania membranes survived in 3 M HCl but showed worse permeability performance than Nafion membranes. Thus, titania might not be the proper membrane material of anion exchange membranes. The cellulose paper coated with Ludox® CL was stable in 1 KOH. Therefore, alumina might be the proper membrane material utilized in alkaline-based organic RFBs.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed December 4, 2018). 0aFlow batteriesxMaterials. 0aOxidation-reduction reaction. 7aOxidation-reduction reaction.2fast0(OCoLC)fst010495640 aCeramic membranes0 aLudox® CL0 aRedox flow batteries0 aTitania0 aChemical engineering 4aThesesxChemical engineering 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aPozzo, Lilo D.,edegree supervisor.40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/42228  aWAUW02768cam a2200481Ii 45000010011000000080041000110060019000520050017000710070014000880400065001021000035001672450083002022640063002852640011003483000056003593360026004153370026004413380036004673470021005033470008005245020048005325040055005805201058006355880097016936500023017906500013018136500017018266500043018436500039018866500049019256530009019746530015019836530024019986530011020226530023020336530025020566550033020816550047021146550028021617000051021898560037022400490009022771014344549171208t20172017waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20190429175958.1cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdOCLCOdOCLCFdWAUdOCLdOCLCQdOCLCO1 aWilliamson, Brian W.,eauthor.10aBiI₃ :ba lower toxicity route to tandem solar cells /cBrian W.

This will result in a large increase in electricity demand. However, any efforts in increasing electricity generation must take into account the health and environmental risks presented by traditional carbon-based fuel sources. Emphasis must be placed on generating electricity from zero-emission sources in an effort to mitigate the effects of climate change. Photovoltaic (PV) electricity generation is one such zero-emission generation method. Highly efficient, cheap, and low toxicity PV materials will be required to address this. In this work, we present an exploration of BiI3 as a solution-processed, lower toxicity PV material. We show that BiI3 films with 1 eV quasi-Fermi level splitting can be obtained from optimal processing conditions. We also explore how and why the different processing conditions influence morphology and optoelectronic quality of BiI3 films. Finally, we discuss some of the limiting factors on achieving high efficiency BiI3 devices.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed December 8, 2017). 0aBismuth compounds. 0aIodides. 0aSolar cells. 7aSolar cells.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01124932 7aIodides.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00978522 7aBismuth compounds.2fast0(OCoLC)fst008334190 aBiI30 aSolar cell0 aSolution processing0 aTandem0 aAlternative energy0 aChemical engineering 4aThesesxChemical engineering 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aHillhouse, Hugh W.,d1972-edegree supervisor.40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/40510  aWAUW03497cam a2200601Ii 45000010011000000080041000110060019000520050017000710070014000880400058001021000031001602450135001912640063003262640011003893000056004003360026004563370026004823380036005083470021005443470008005655020048005735040055006215201226006765880097019026500014019996500028020136500023020416500032020646500022020966500024021186500012021426500012021546500058021666500048022246500038022726500040023106500050023506500038024006500049024386500054024876530022025416530023025636530031025866530034026176530024026516530025026756550033027006550047027336550028027807000041028088560037028490490009028861077480482181204t20182018waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20190803135222.9cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdOCLCFdWAUdOCLCQdOCLCOdOCL1 aWu, Kejia,d1992-eauthor.10aExploring serine-lysine peptide aggregation in water and interaction with inorganic surfaces using molecular dynamics /cKejia Wu. 1a[Seattle] :b[University of Washington Libraries],c[2018] 4c©2018  a1 online resource (34 pages) :bcolor illustrations  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext file2rdaft  bPDF  bM.S.

Inspired by the richness of both lysine and serine amino acids in biomineralization activities, four different S-K peptides were designed to examine their specific qualities for aggregation in water as well as roles in titania (TiO₂) or silica (SiO₂) precipitation. To mimic the experimental counterparts, TiO₂ and SiO₂ under neutral condition are chosen as the inorganic surface models here. Considering the time limitation and possible driving force, we applied our new enhanced sampling method (PBmetaD-PF) with identical components to provide new molecular-level insight into the aggregation process and structures. In second part, we did reweighting and clustering analysis to find out dominant states and structures for each system, and investigated their interaction with inorganic surfaces after testing their stability respectively. Different binding forces between the two metal oxide surfaces were studied and discussed in detail.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed December 4, 2018). 0aPeptides. 0aAggregation (Chemistry) 0aBiomineralization. 0aTitanium dioxidexSurfaces. 0aSilicaxSurfaces. 0aMolecular dynamics. 0aSerine. 0aLysine. 7aTitanium dioxidexSurfaces.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01151578 7aSilicaxSurfaces.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01118595 7aSerine.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01113204 7aPeptides.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01057564 7aMolecular dynamics.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01024778 7aLysine.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01004388 7aBiomineralization.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00832622 7aAggregation (Chemistry)2fast0(OCoLC)fst008002550 aBiomineralization0 aInorganic surfaces0 aLysine and serine residues0 aMolecular dynamics simulation0 aPeptide aggregation0 aChemical engineering 4aThesesxChemical engineering 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aPfaendtner, Jim,edegree supervisor.40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/42226  aWAUW02957cam a2200553Ii 45000010011000000080041000110060019000520050017000710070014000880400044001021000028001462450100001742640063002742640011003373000067003483360026004153370026004413380036004673470021005033470008005245020049005325040053005815200917006345880099015516500030016506500023016806500022017036500033017256500019017586500016017776500049017936500056018426500048018986500059019466500044020056500042020496530013020916530012021046530020021166530009021366530025021456530019021706550034021896550047022236550028022707000059022988560037023570490009023941120724183190923t20192019waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20200130114059.1cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdOCLCFdWAUdOCL1 aXi, Chenggang,eauthor.10aMulti-Ribozyme-gRNA-Aptazyme (RGA) networks for biosensing and gene regulation /cChenggang Xi. 1a[Seattle] :b[University of Washington Libraries],c[2019] 4c©2019  a1 online resource (29 unnumbered pages) :bcolor illustrations  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext file2rdaft  bPDF  bM.S.

However, further development of those applications calls for effective charge transport of conjugated polymers. Engineering their assembly to form ordered structures is key to enhancing the electrical properties. In this dissertation, external electric and acoustic fields have been demonstrated to effectively direct polymer assembly into fibers and the addition of polar poor solvents can self-assemble donor-acceptor conjugated polymers into nanoribbons with long-range order. To form detailed correlations between external controllable variables and the resulted nanostructures, a systematic investigation on the effects of tuning electric field frequency and amplitude, acoustic field peak negative pressure, as well as poor solvent polarity, is performed. Structure-property relationships are formed and mechanistic discussions on directed- and self- assembly are presented. Different polymers are explored to form general molecular design guidelines that can be beneficial to structure manipulation. This work provides insights into engineering structures for enhanced charge transport by controlling the assembly of conjugated polymers.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed December 4, 2018). 0aConjugated polymersxStructure. 0aConjugated polymersxSynthesis. 0aConjugated polymersxElectric properties.0 aConjugated polymers0 aDirected-assembly0 aNano-structure0 aSANS0 aSelf assembly0 aMaterials Science0 aChemical engineering 4aThesesxChemical engineering 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aPozzo, Lilo D.,edegree supervisor.40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/42223  aWAUW02516cam a2200409Ii 45000010011000000080041000110060019000520050017000710070014000880400044001021000033001462450090001792640063002692640011003323000061003433360026004043370026004303380036004563470021004923470008005135020049005215040055005705200960006255880098015856500042016836500034017256500022017596500048017816530025018296550034018546550047018886550028019357000044019637000053020078560037020600490009020971117715296190909t20192019waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20200115191656.3cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdOCLCFdWAUdOCL1 aXiao, Sijia,d1995-eauthor.10aMachine learning of amino acid composition models for protein redesign /cSijia Xiao. 1a[Seattle] :b[University of Washington Libraries],c[2019] 4c©2019  a1 online resource (iii, 29 pages) :bcolor illustrations  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext file2rdaft  bPDF  bM.S.

However, most of the mesophilic proteins are vulnerable to such extreme condition due to their different amino acid composition. Improve the thermostability of thermophilic proteins will reduce the cost of from storage and production in industrial process. Nowadays, machine learning becomes a powerful method for data-intensive computation. This work provides a well-tuned network, called Thermalizer, which applies Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to encode the mesophilic proteins to thermostable proteins which is predicted to be able to perform expected function in higher temperature. The toolkit also provides workflow from gene and amino acid sequence preprocessing to encoder and decoder construction, model training and evaluation, and translation window.

This causes huge burden on marine vessels and structures. Environmental friendly coatings are highly desirable to replace existing toxic coatings. Extensive efforts have been devoted to the development of environmental friendly and effective anti-fouling marine coatings. We have developed zwitterionic self-polishing coatings, which combine self-polishing and non-fouling properties for long-term performance for applications including marine. Non-fouling behaviors are studied by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) while self-polishing behaviors are followed by weight loss. By varying the composition of coatings, self-polishing rates and non-fouling behaviors can be controlled.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed September 19, 2017). 0aPaint, Antifouling. 0aShipsxFoulingxPrevention. 0aPolyzwitterions. 7aPaint, Antifouling.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01050490 7aPolyzwitterions.2fast0(OCoLC)fst017395290 aChemical engineering 4aThesesxChemical engineering 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aJiang, Shaoyi,d1964-edegree supervisor.1http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q8856592040uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/39981  aWAUW02545cam a2200433Ii 4500001001000000008004100010006001900051005001700070007001400087040006700101100003400168245008100202264006300283264001100346300005600357336002600413337002600439338003600465347002400501502004100525504005500566520090600621588009601527650003501623650001901658650001201677650001401689650006101703650004501764650004001809650003801849653002501887655003401912655004701946655002801993700004402021856003702065049000902102956508322160811t20162016waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20190619182425.1cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdOCLCOdOCLCFdWAUdOCLCAdOCLCQdOCLCO1 aYang, Wenlan,d1992-eauthor.10aChemically-addressable protein entrapment in silica sol-gels /cWenlan Yang. 1a[Seattle] :b[University of Washington Libraries],c[2016] 4c©2016  a1 online resource (26 pages) :bcolor illustrations  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext filebPDF2rda  bM.S.cUniversity of Washingtond2016  aIncludes bibliographical references (pages 25-26).3 aSilica-based sol-gel materials as carriers for immobilization of biological species and subsequent controllable release have experienced great examination since past decade. The transparent and robust network possesses inert and stable physicochemical properties, allowing a variety of biomolecules to be successfully entrapped, including proteins, antibodies and antigens, cells. Controlled and effective release is usually achieved by functionalization of the silica matrices to physically cap the pores by modified nanoparticles serving as nanovalves. In this study, fusion proteins with a designed silica-binding peptide tag are immobilized during the sol-gel formation, and subsequently be released with a tag-specified eluent. The release kinetics have been studied under various conditions to demonstrate the chemically-addressable tag-mediated protein sequestration in silica sol-gel matrices.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed August 11, 2016). 0aControlled release technology. 0aNanoparticles. 0aSilica. 0aProteins. 7aControlled release technology.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00877109 7aNanoparticles.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01032624 7aProteins.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01079711 7aSilica.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01118585  aChemical engineering 4aThesesxChemical engineering. 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aBaneyx, François,edegree supervisor.40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/36526  aWAUW03674cam a2200505Ii 45000010011000000080041000110060019000520050017000710070014000880400056001021000039001582450099001972640063002962640011003593000072003703360026004423370026004683380036004943470021005303470008005515000010005595020044005695040057006135201836006705880095025066500047026016500018026486500025026666500051026916500044027426530013027866530016027996530018028156530019028336530012028526530017028646530025028816530019029066550028029256550034029536550047029877000088030348560037031220490009031591097200234190415t20182018waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20210721172105.2cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdOCLCFdWAUdOCLdWAUdOCLCO1 aZhang, Peng,d1987 May 3-eauthor.10aImproving safety and efficacy of protein therapeutics by chemical modifications /cPeng Zhang. 1a[Seattle] :b[University of Washington Libraries],c[2018] 4c©2018  a1 online resource (xiv, 156 pages) :billustrations (chiefly color)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext file2rdaft  bPDF  aVita.  bPh.

However, their applications are greatly limited due to undesired immune responses, which not only reduce their therapeutic efficacy, but also cause many adverse effects including anaphylaxis and infusion reactions. Although several PEGylated protein drugs were brought into clinic, they are still vulnerable to anti-PEG antibodies. In this dissertation, tactics to improve the efficacy and safety of protein therapeutics are discussed. Learning lessons from PEGylation, a zwitterionic gel encapsulation technology is developed to protect protein drugs from body clearance and immune recognition. This strategy is proved to be effective in increasing protein stability, prolonging in vivo circulation half-life and reducing immunogenicity, and is successfully applied to uricase, butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) and organophosphate hydrolase (OPH) for both therapeutic and protective applications. In addition, several new capabilities have also been developed in the course of this work. First, to reduce current PEG related clinical risks, a surface plasmon resonance biosensor is applied to detect anti-PEG antibodies quantitatively with better sensitivity than direct ELISA. Second, to solve potential organ accumulation and associated toxicity problems, a carboxybetaine group functionalized polypeptide is synthesized to introduce biodegradability to the protein modification material. Third, to handle highly immunogenic therapeutics, an immunomodulatory bioconjugation is developed to proactively suppress anti-drug antibodies. These new technologies have the potential to improve the pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity of currently marketed biopharmaceutics, and unlock the possibility of adopting highly immunogenic proteins to improve human health.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed April 15, 2019). 0aProteinsxTherapeutic usexAdministration. 0aNanocapsules. 0aPolyethylene glycol. 7aPolyethylene glycol.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01070447 7aNanocapsules.2fast0(OCoLC)fst018947140 aAnti-PEG0 aBiomaterial0 aDrug delivery0 aImmunogenicity0 aProtein0 aZwitterionic0 aChemical engineering0 aBioengineering 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft 4aThesesxChemical engineering. 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst017264531 aJiang, Shaoyi,d1964-edegree supervisor.1http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q8856592040uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/43320  aWAUW02508cam a2200445Ii 45000010011000000080041000110060019000520050017000710070014000880400058001021000035001602450108001952640063003032640011003663000070003773360026004473370026004733380036004993470021005353470008005565020048005645040055006125200806006675880097014736500049015706500031016196500032016506500057016826530026017396530021017656530017017866530022018036530025018256550033018506550047018836550028019307000058019588560037020160490009020531077480172181204t20182018waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20190713032638.1cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdOCLCFdWAUdOCLCQdOCLCOdOCL1 aZhang, Shijie,d1994-eauthor.10aMechanical simulation of human pleura for medical training by crosslinked polyurethane /cShijie Zhang. 1a[Seattle] :b[University of Washington Libraries],c[2018] 4c©2018  a1 online resource (iv, 27 pages) :billustrations (chiefly color)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext file2rdaft  bPDF  bM.S.

As a result, two partial crosslinked PUs are proved to be promising candidates for pleura simulator, with perfect matches on ultimate tensile strength (UTS) and stretch ratio (SR) of human pleura, indicating the great potential to use PU synthetics to mimic the mechanical behavior of pleura and other human tissues for medical training purpose.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed December 4, 2018). 0aCrosslinked polymersxMechanical properties. 0aPolyurethanes in medicine. 0aPleuraxSimulation methods. 7aPolyurethanes in medicine.2fast0(OCoLC)fst010708380 aMechanical properties0 aMedical training0 aPolyurethane0 aTissue simulation0 aChemical engineering 4aThesesxChemical engineering 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aRatner, B.

PDs using organic and inorganic nanocomposites as active layers with a photodiode configuration could achieve photomultiplication and naorrowband photoresponse via the control of microstructure and thickness of active layers. Here, we fabricated flexible UV PDs on indium tin oxide (ITO) coated polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrates with a nanocomposite active layer composed of ZnO nanoparticles blended with wide band gap conjugate polymer poly[(9,9-dioctylfluorenyl-2,7-diyl)-alt-co-(bithiophene)] (F8T2). As a result of wavelength-dependent penetration depth of light in the active layer, the fabricated flexible UV PDs showed two narrow response peaks at 360 and 510 nm under reverse biases in the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra with full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) less than 20 nm. Both responses exhibited greater than 100% EQE, indicating photomultiplication effect, while the UV response at 360 nm was 10 times stronger under -15 V bias. The fabricated flexible UV PDs were bent under both tensile and compressive stress to a curvature of 2.1 cm⁻¹, each with 50 repetitions. The peak specific detectivity (D∗) only decreased by about 5% in total, the FWHM was well retained below 20 nm and the response speed remained almost constant after two types of bending, demonstrating mechanical flexibility and photoresponse stability of the fabricated flexible UV PDs. The photodiode configuration with nanocomposite active layers offers a promising route to make flexible and conformable narrowband, photomultiplication-type photodetectors for modern applications. 0aOptical detectorsxMaterials.0 aFlexible0 aNanocomposite0 aNarrowband0 aPhotomultiplication0 aUltraviolet photodetectors0 aChemical engineering 4aThesesxChemical engineering 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aYu, Qiuming,d1963-edegree supervisor.40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/42225  aWAUW03367cam a2200565Ii 45000010011000000080041000110060019000520050017000710070014000880400044001021000033001462450092001792640063002712640011003343000070003453360026004153370026004413380036004673470021005033470008005245020049005325040055005815201318006365880098019546500025020526500019020776500028020966500032021246500012021566500014021686500038021826500051022206500040022716500045023116500058023566500054024146530013024686530016024816530009024976530021025066530024025276530026025516530025025776550034026026550047026366550028026837000044027118560037027550490009027921117715200190909t20192019waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20200130213138.4cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdOCLCFdWAUdOCL1 aZhao, Yundi,d1995-eauthor.10aStimuli-responsive assembly of nanoparticles with solid binding proteins /cYundi Zhao. 1a[Seattle] :b[University of Washington Libraries],c[2019] 4c©2019  a1 online resource (ii, 31 pages) :billustrations (chiefly color)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext file2rdaft  bPDF  bM.S.

When genetically encoded within proteins, SBPs can function as linkers to create hybrid materials comprising inorganic components and the proteins to which they are fused. In this project, we explored how such solid binding proteins may be employed to achieve dynamic control over the assembly and disassembly of silica nanoparticles and how the process is influenced by SBP sequence, insertion point, and solution conditions. Using fluorescent-resonant energy transfer (FRET), dynamic light scattering (DLS) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), we show that bifunctional derivatives of super-folder green fluorescent protein (sfGFP) engineered with two strong, or with a strong and a weak silica-binding peptides support the pH-dependent aggregation and disaggregation of rhodamine-containing silica nanoparticle (RhSiNP). We further demonstrate that pH shifts can be used to cycle nanoparticle between assembled and dispersed states and that aggregate size can be tuned with different SBPs and salt concentrations. This new paradigm for the synthesis of dynamic nanoparticle systems should find applications in biosensing, diagnostics and advanced materials.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed September 9, 2019). 0aProtein engineering. 0aNanoparticles. 0aAggregation (Chemistry) 0aHydrogen-ion concentration. 0aSilica. 0aPeptides. 7aSilica.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01118585 7aProtein engineering.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01079685 7aPeptides.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01057564 7aNanoparticles.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01032624 7aHydrogen-ion concentration.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00965064 7aAggregation (Chemistry)2fast0(OCoLC)fst008002550 aAssembly0 aDisassembly0 aFRET0 aHybrid materials0 aSilica nanoparticle0 aSolid binding peptide0 aChemical engineering 4aThesesxChemical engineering. 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aBaneyx, François,edegree supervisor.40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/44086  aWAUW02960cam a2200517Ii 45000010011000000080041000110060019000520050017000710070014000880400065001021000027001672450122001942640063003162640011003793000059003903360026004493370026004753380036005013470021005373470008005585020048005665040055006145201100006695880097017696500023018666500016018896500016019056500031019216500042019526500042019946500049020366530036020856530015021216530018021366530018021546530009021726530016021816530022021976530025022196550033022446550047022776550028023247000044023528560037023960490009024331014345282171208t20172017waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20190429175848.4cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdOCLCOdOCLCFdWAUdOCLdOCLCQdOCLCO1 aZheng, Erjin,eauthor.10aSolution-processed visible-blind UV-A photodetectors based on CH₃NH₃PbCl₃ Perovskite thin films /cErjin Zheng. 1a[Seattle] :b[University of Washington Libraries],c[2017] 4c©2017  a1 online resource (v, 35 pages) :bcolor illustrations  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext file2rdaft  bPDF  bM.S.

Antigens or adjuvants that are derived from various pathogens are diverse in a number of physical chemical properties, such as size, charge, and solubility. A polymer nanoparticle system made of the mixture of pH-insensitive polymer, such as poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) and pH-sensitive polymer has been developed in our lab for vaccine delivery. By modulating the ratio of pH-responsive copolymers, we were able to control both intracellular and extracellular release of protein antigens with different charge properties. Co-delivering the mixture of optimized antigen and adjuvants particles to mice subcutaneously, the quantity and quality of both primary and memory immunity were successfully improved compared to the positive control which contained antigen mixed with aluminum hydroxide (Alum) adjuvant. Unlike Alum, which induced Th2-dominant humoral responses, blend particles elicited robust Th1-dominant responses. Additionally, the quality of cellular responses was improved by blend particle systems. Higher level of polyfunctional CD4+ T cells was induced by particles compared to Alum control. In combination of a novel mucosal vaccination strategy, this particle system was tested to protect mice from genital Herpes Simplex Virus-2 (HSV-2) infection. More than 500 millions of people are estimated to be infected with HSV-2 worldwide and HSV-2 seropositive persons have a 2 to 4 fold increased risk of acquiring HIV-1 infection. Lacking sufficient immunity, candidate HSV-2 vaccines that were protective in animal model, however, have not been successful in human clinical studies in decades. Our results showed that our strategy recruited sufficient immunity in local tissue and has efficiently protected the mice against HSV-2 infection. This pH-responsive blend particle system represents a simple and promising delivery platform for subunit vaccine development against viral infections.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed March 4, 2015). 0aVaccinesxControlled release. 0aPolymeric drug delivery systemsxMaterials. 0aVirus diseasesxImmunological aspects. 0aHerpes simplex virus. 7aHerpes simplex virus.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00955637 7aVirus diseasesxImmunological aspects.2fast0(OCoLC)fst011677490 aAdaptive immunity0 aMucosal viral infection0 aPH-sensitive particle0 aVaccine delivery 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 4aThesesxChemical engineering. 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aShen, Hong,d1972-edegree supervisor.40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/26166  aWAUW03146cam a2200469Ii 4500001001000000008004100010006001900051005001700070007001400087040007000101100003100171245011600202264006300318264001100381300007200392336002600464337002600490338003600516347002400552502004300576500001000619504005700629520131600686588009802002650002102100650002702121650002902148650004102177650004702218650006702265653002102332653002002353653001802373653002502391653001702416655004702433655003402480655002802514700008802542856003702630049000902667898363688141219t20142014waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20210721171229.3cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdWAUdOCLCFdOCLCQdOCLCOdOCLdWAUdOCLCO1 aYang, Wei,d1980-eauthor.10aZwitterionic poly(carboxybetaine) materials for blood-contacting medical devices and nanoparticles /cWei Yang. 1a[Seattle] :b[University of Washington Libraries],c[2014] 4c©2014  a1 online resource (xii, 141 pages) :billustrations (chiefly color)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext filebPDF2rda  bPh.

It degrades the performance of surface-based implanted devices and causes nanoparticles to be recognized by the immune system and rapidly eliminated from systemic circulation. The presented work is a compilation of efforts aimed at developing surface coating based on PCB materials for blood-contacting medical devices and nanoparticles. Surfaces with different packing densities were applied for various purposes. An amperometric enzyme glucose sensor based on glucose oxidase, was used to demonstrate the extraordinary performance of a lightly crosslinked PCB hydrogel in whole blood. This hydrogel presents an ultra-low fouling background to maintain a stable long-term response, even in whole blood. In addition, gold nanoparticles were used as a model system to demonstrate that NPs protected by PCB materials with a high packing density elicit an extremely low immune response after repeated injections, along with having prolonged circulation time and low accumulation in organs in vivo. Finally, ligands with only one CB group were developed to prepare thin surface coatings via self-assembled monolayers. The functional ligands are highly resistant to pH changes, as well as nonspecific protein adsorption.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed December 19, 2014). 0aPolyzwitterions. 0aBiosensorsxMaterials. 0aNanoparticlesxSurfaces. 0aProteinsxAbsorption and adsorption. 7aPolyzwitterions.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01739529 7aProteinsxAbsorption and adsorption.2fast0(OCoLC)fst010797120 aBlood-contacting0 aMedical devices0 aNanoparticles0 aPoly(carboxybetaine)0 aZwitterionic 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 4aThesesxChemical engineering. 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aJiang, Shaoyi,d1964-edegree supervisor.1http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q8856592040uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/26502  aWAUW06169cam a2200541Ii 4500001001000000008004100010006001900051005001700070007001400087040009100101100003800192245011700230264006300347264001100410300006200421336002600483337002600509338003600535347002100571347000800592502004300600500001000643504005700653520409400710588009404804650002904898650002304927650002404950650002504974650001504999650004105014650005105055650005005106650005505156650004905211653001605260653001405276653002705290653002205317653002705339653001905366655003305385655002805418655004705446700008805493856003705581049000905618906739065150407t20142014waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20201124235737.7cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdOCLCOdWAUdOCLCAdOCLCQdOCLCOdWAUdOCLCFdOCLCQdOCLCOdWAU1 aWolcott, Christopher A.,eauthor.10aEnergetics of elementary steps in catalysis and their use to search for new catalysts /cChristopher A.

Whether it is the fuel in a car, the fertilizers used to make food, or the plastics present in just about everything, these chemicals are so ubiquitous that it is difficult to imagine living in a world without them. Nearly all consumer chemicals are produced through a catalytic process, the vast majority of which are heterogeneous. On top of their current, massive presence, heterogeneous catalysts are also expected to play an important role in new emerging technologies such as fuel cells, hydrogen production, green chemistry, and more. Considering their ubiquity in the present and their potential uses in the future, it is no surprise that improving catalyst performance is a very active area of research. Yet despite their ubiquity, and despite their long history of active study, there remains much which is unknown about the fundamentals of catalysts on surfaces. One of the major gaps is in quantitative understanding of the energetics of elementary steps in catalytic reactions on surfaces. The stability or instability of molecules and molecular fragments adsorbed on surfaces in these elementary steps is KEY to understanding what makes one material an effective catalyst and another less effective. In general, one must use single-crystal model catalysts to produce well-defined adsorbates. Classic studies of the energetics of adsorbates on such surfaces have typically involved techniques (such as temperature programmed desorption or equilibrium adsorption experiments) which limit the types of systems which can be studied to those where adsorption is reversible. For most catalytic intermediates present in these elementary steps, this is not the case. Upon adsorption and heating many molecules fall apart and produce strongly bound adsorbates which further dissociate at higher temperatures, or will not leave the surface until they have reacted with something else. Single crystal adsorption calorimetry (SCAC) is a fairly new technique which allows one to probe the heats of formation of such adsorbates for the first time. In this thesis SCAC is used to study the dissociative adsorption of diiodomethane on Pt(111) to produce adsorbed -CH₂ and -CH, and water on Fe₃O₄(111) and NiO(111) to produce adsorbed -OH. This work expands the library of adsorbates on transition metal surfaces which has been studied by SCAC, and is among the first ever measurements of molecules on well-defined oxide surfaces using SCAC. These results are compared to density functional theory (DFT) calculations of adsorbate energetics, and their use as computational benchmarks is discussed. A new, universally-applicable method of data analysis for SCAC is also developed which allows for the extraction of heat data even in the presence of complex surface reaction/diffusion dynamics without any need for kinetic modeling as required in previous analysis methods, thus greatly expanding the versatility of SCAC. Finally a new method of computational catalyst screening is presented which uses the concept of degree of rate control to simplify calculations compared to the standard method developed by Jens Nørskov's group. It greatly reduces the number of adsorbate energies needed to predict the reaction rate for a new catalyst, and provides greater accuracy when studying materials with similar properties to the reference catalyst used. The Nørskov method is more robust when extended to materials that are dissimilar. The new method presented here is thus expected to be an important complimentary tool to Nørskov's method for high-throughput computational screening. Taken together, the results presented in this dissertation show the importance of experimental measurements for guiding the development of fast quantum mechanical methods like DFT to more closely approach thru "chemical accuracy" in energetic prediction, and how one could use "chemically accurate" DFT energies to rapidly screen potential catalysts for computational catalyst discovery to advance energy and environmental technologies.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed April 7, 2015). 0aHeterogeneous catalysis. 0aSurface chemistry. 0aHeat of adsorption. 0aDensity functionals. 0aCatalysts. 7aCatalysts.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00848875 7aDensity functionals.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00890362 7aHeat of adsorption.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00953902 7aHeterogeneous catalysis.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00955748 7aSurface chemistry.2fast0(OCoLC)fst011392100 aCalorimetry0 aCatalysis0 aDegree of Rate Control0 aSurface Chemistry0 aSurface Thermodynamics0 aThermodynamics 4aThesesxChemical engineering 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst017264531 aCampbell, Charles T.,edegree supervisor.1http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q8768742940uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/27431  aWAUW04733cam a2200505Ii 4500001001000000008004100010006001900051005001700070007001400087040006300101100004000164245014500204264006300349264001100412300007300423336002600496337002600522338003600548347002100584347000800605502004300613504005700656520275000713588009803463650002403561650001703585650002403602650002903626650002003655650004303675650005003718650005503768650005003823650004603873653001503919653001603934653001403950653002003964655003403984655002804018655004704046700008804093856003704181049000904218898189921141216t20142014waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20201124235714.8cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdWAUdOCLCFdOCLCQdOCLCOdOCLdWAU1 aSilbaugh, Trent L.,d1986-eauthor.10aThermodynamics and kinetics of elementary surface reaction steps in catalysis by single crystal adsorption calorimetry /cTrent L.

One of the most important application fields among these technologies is heterogeneous catalysis, which includes chemical manufacturing, energy generation, conversion and storage and environmental technology. Many of the related processes include one or more steps catalyzed at solid interfaces or involve adsorption of gaseous molecules. For the rational design of new catalytic and other functional materials, a detailed knowledge of the energetics of the adsorbate-surface interaction and the thermodynamics of surface reaction intermediates is required. Recent results have revealed that state-of-the-art computational methods based on density functional theory have far greater energy errors than originally believed, so they are insufficient for this task. The data set of experimental benchmarks needed to improve these is also still far too limited. Thus, more measurements of adsorption energies are badly needed. Because many of these important intermediates exist in metastable states, traditional experimental techniques that rely on reversible desorption of adsorbed species to get adsorption energies (i.e. temperature programmed desorption and equilibrium adsorption isotherms) cannot be used. In this thesis, single crystal adsorption calorimetry (SCAC), which allows for the direct measurement of heat deposition during surface adsorption and reaction processes, is utilized to determine the energetics of several simple adsorbed molecular fragments on Pt(111). A new data analysis method is introduced here that allows SCAC to be used to simultaneously probe the thermodynamics as well as kinetics of surface reactions. This analysis method is used to provide the rate barriers for elementary steps in the decomposition of formic acid on oxygen precovered Pt(111). A review of all SCAC studies of molecular adsorption and reaction is also provided, and important recent results from this body of literature is discussed. A correlation of bond enthalpies determined from SCAC data to gas phase bond enthalpies has provided a linear relationship that allows for the prediction of surface bond strengths from gas phase data. Also, using energetics from several SCAC and TPD studies, a complete energy landscape for the oxidation of methanol and formic acid on oxygen precovered Pt(111) has been generated which provides insight into the mechanism of this process. A comparison of experimental bond energies to values obtained from density functional theory (DFT) calculations shows that errors in standard DFT can be quite large, particularly for systems with large van der Waals interactions, and that these errors are not systematic.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed December 16, 2014). 0aHeat of adsorption. 0aCalorimetry. 0aPlatinumxSurfaces. 0aHeterogeneous catalysis. 0aThermodynamics. 7aCalorimetry.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00844526 7aHeat of adsorption.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00953902 7aHeterogeneous catalysis.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00955748 7aPlatinumxSurfaces.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01066841 7aThermodynamics.2fast0(OCoLC)fst011498320 aAdsorption0 aCalorimetry0 aCatalysis0 aSurface Science 4aThesesxChemical engineering. 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst017264531 aCampbell, Charles T.,edegree supervisor.1http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q8768742940uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/26501  aWAUW03764cam a2200481Ii 4500001001000000008004100010006001900051005001700070007001400087040008400101100003200185245010100217264006300318264001100381300005400392336002600446337002600472338003600498347002400534502004300558500001000601504005700611520185500668588009902523650002102622650002502643650004102668650002502709650005102734650004702785650006702832650005102899653001402950653002502964653003502989653001503024655004703039655003403086655002803120700008803148856003703236049000903273890665148140916t20142014waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20210721171530.6cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdWAUdOCLCOdOCLCFdOCLCOdOCLCQdOCLCOdOCLdWAUdOCLCO1 aShao, Qing,d1981-eauthor.10aUnderstanding properties of zwitterionic materials from their molecular structures /cQing Shao. 1a[Seattle] :b[University of Washington Libraries],c[2014] 4c©2014  a1 online resource (x, 147 pages) :billustrations  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext filebPDF2rda  bPh.

Zwitterionic materials have shown unique properties for this purpose. But two critical questions about zwitterionic materials remain unsolved. First, why are zwitterionic materials different from non-ionic materials? Second, what are the differences among zwitterionic materials? This work aims to answer the two questions and design new zwitterionic materials based on the solutions. To study the differences between zwitterionic and non-ionic materials, this work investigated the effects of carboxybetaine (CB) and oligo(ethylene glycol) (OEG) moieties on protein structure and hydrophobic interactions. Non-ionic OEG moieties present amphiphilic features. They mask the hydrophobic domains of protein surfaces and impede hydrophobic associations in aqueous solutions. Zwitterionic CB moieties present superhydrophilic features. They do not influence hydrophobic substrates and hydrophobic associations. To study the differences among zwitterionic materials, this work studied hydration, ionic interactions, and self-associations of CB and sulfobetaine (SB) moieties; and the influences of carbon spacer length on hydration and ionic interactions of CB moieties. This work employed quantum mechanics, molecular dynamics simulations, free energy perturbation methods and well-tempered metadynamics simulations. Finally, properties of 12 zwitterionic moieties were studied to look for new nonfouling zwitterionic materials. The work suggests three criteria for assessing protein-resistant zwitterionic materials: strong hydration, few or moderate self-associations, and few specific interactions with proteins.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed September 16, 2014). 0aPolyzwitterions. 0aMolecular structure. 0aProteinsxAbsorption and adsorption. 0aProteinsxStructure. 7aMolecular structure.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01024846 7aPolyzwitterions.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01739529 7aProteinsxAbsorption and adsorption.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01079712 7aProteinsxStructure.2fast0(OCoLC)fst010797590 aHydration0 aMolecular simulation0 aNonspecific protein adsorption0 aZwitterion 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 4aThesesxChemical engineering. 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aJiang, Shaoyi,d1964-edegree supervisor.1http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q8856592040uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/25365  aWAUW04746cam a2200409Ii 4500001001000000008004100010006001900051005001700070007001400087040005800101100003200159245008600191264006300277264001100340300007000351336002600421337002600447338003600473347002400509502004300533500001000576504005700586520319800643588009903841650004903940650007503989653001304064653001504077653001804092653002504110655004704135655003404182655002804216700004604244856003704290049000904327890665632140916t20142014waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20190926201729.2cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdWAUdOCLCFdOCLCQdOCLCOdOCL1 aRutz, Benjamin H.,eauthor.10aImprovement of mechanical properties of polymeric composites /cBenjamin H.

Their low weight, high strength and stiffness and resistance to corrosion make them particularly well suited for aerospace applications. The next generation of aircraft, including the Boeing 787 and the Airbus A350, are made largely out of continuous fiber reinforced plastics, reducing fuel consumption and improving range. The continued growth of the market is dependent not only on improving manufacturability and reducing cost, but also on the continuous improvement of material properties, necessitating the development of new materials and an improved understanding of the chemistry and mechanics of composites. Composite properties are dependent on many factors including the properties of the constituent phases, their relative volume fraction, their spatial orientation and arrangement, and the adhesion between them. It is recognized that good composite mechanical properties are dependent on a strong and tough adhesive bond between the polymer and the reinforcement, necessitating the development of novel techniques to improve the adhesion. Additionally, with the weight sensitive applications of polymeric composites, a reduction in the material weight, without adversely affecting mechanical properties, is desired. In the current study, the adhesion in both continuous fiber and particulate reinforced plastics is investigated, as is the synthesis of a nano-void lightened resin. More specifically, the applied stress necessary to cause adhesive failure in a particulate composite, as a function of interparticle separation and surface functionalization is determined with in situ transmitted light optical microscopy. A simple model is developed for the system, based on the superposition of stress concentrations, determined with an analytical solution, and a critical local tensile stress failure criterion. For continuous fiber reinforced plastics, the use of electrostatically deposited poly(ethyleneimine) functionalized silica nanoparticles as a means to improve the interfacial shear strength is investigated. The use of these topological surface modifiers, in contrast to the typical chemical modification of the interface, provides an increase in surface area and mechanical interlock, improving the adhesion, as measured by the single fiber fragmentation test. The particle size is optimized, as very small particles, <26 nm, do not appreciably increase the surface roughness, while large particles,>71 nm, are too large, and do not improve the adhesion. A method for reducing the density of a thermosetting resin is discussed. From a literature review, it is established that the most promising means for the incorporation of nano-voids into a thermoset is with blowing agent wells, self-assembled block copolymer micelles that solubilize blowing agent. A number of potential block copolymers are studied, and blowing agent wells are successfully made with the commercially available block copolymer epoxy-toughener Dow Fortegra®, which are used to solubilize heptane. The method for controlled vaporization of the blowing agent to make a low density material is still under development.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed September 16, 2014). 0aPolymeric compositesxMechanical properties. 7aPolymeric compositesxMechanical properties.2fast0(OCoLC)fst010705670 aAdhesion0 aComposites0 aSelf-assembly0 aStress concentration 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 4aThesesxChemical engineering. 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aBerg, John C.,d1937-edegree supervisor.40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/25367  aWAUW03617cam a2200493Ii 4500001001000000008004100010006001900051005001700070007001400087040005800101100003700159245014100196264006300337264001100400300007100411336002600482337002600508338003600534347002400570502004300594504004100637520174000678588009702418650002802515650002502543650001602568650001902584650001602603650005102619650004202670650004502712650005402757650004202811653001302853653002402866653001502890653002302905655004702928655003402975655002803009700004003037856003703077049000903114902749844150204t20142014waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20190926163756.4cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdWAUdOCLCFdOCLCQdOCLCOdOCL1 aRichards, Jeffrey John,eauthor.10aStructural characterization of composite thin-film and dispersed phase conjugated polymer/fullerene composites /cJeffrey John Richards. 1a[Seattle] :b[University of Washington Libraries],c[2014] 4c©2014  a1 online resource (vi, 179 pages) :billustrations (chiefly color)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext filebPDF2rda  bPh.

The efficiency of exciton dissociation and carrier transport to the working electrodes are both a function of the size and distribution of polymer and fullerene domains within the active layer. In the current solution processing paradigm, these characteristics are intrinsically linked to the detailed process history of the film. This fact compromises the promise of polymer solar cells as an inexpensive renewable energy technology because performance gains made in the laboratory may not translate well to scaled-up manufacturing processes. Aqueous dispersions of conjugated polymer/fullerene nanoparticles have the potential to address this challenge. Similar to their thin-film counterparts, the performance of photovoltaic devices derived from conjugated polymer/fullerene composite nanoparticles (CNPs) is a function of the structural morphology within each nanoparticle. However, whereas the structural morphology of an active layer produced using solution phase deposition is a function of the detailed history of the coating process, the structure of CNPs is fixed during their formulation. Because of this fact, the structure can be identified in the dispersed phase and tied, using single particle characterization, to its photovoltaic performance before it is deposited into a device. Therefore, the optimization of devices derived from CNPs can be broken into two discrete problems: improving the intrinsic properties of a nanoparticle as a function of how it is produced and optimizing the extrinsic properties of devices through the deposition of optimized CNPs.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed February 4, 2015). 0aSolar cellsxMaterials. 0aConjugated polymers. 0aFullerenes. 0aNanoparticles. 0aThin films. 7aConjugated polymers.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01741276 7aFullerenes.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00936022 7aNanoparticles.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01032624 7aSolar cellsxMaterials.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01124941 7aThin films.2fast0(OCoLC)fst011500180 aColloids0 aConjugated Polymers0 aFullerenes0 aNeutron Scattering 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 4aThesesxChemical engineering. 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aPozzo, Lilo D.,edegree supervisor.40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/26169  aWAUW03208cam a2200481Ii 4500001001000000008004100010006001900051005001700070007001400087040006500101100004000166245012400206264006300330264001100393300007100404336002600475337002600501338003600527347002400563502004300587500001000630504005700640520137100697588009702068650002502165650003002190650003602220650001602256650005102272650005602323650004202379653002302421653002302444653002302467653002402490653001802514655004702532655003302579655002802612700004002640856003702680049000902717897839840141209t20142014waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20190926192250.4cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdOCLCQdWAUdOCLCFdOCLCQdOCLCOdOCL1 aNewbloom, Gregory Matthew,eauthor.10aEngineering the multi-length scale structure of self-assembled conjugated polymer networks /cGregory Matthew Newbloom. 1a[Seattle] :b[University of Washington Libraries],c[2014] 4c©2014  a1 online resource (xi, 252 pages) :billustrations (chiefly color)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext filebPDF2rda  bPh.

These applications have varying, but optimized, structure and property requirements which often include an interconnected network of conjugated polymers to transport charge. In this work, self-assembly and gelation are explored as a platform to engineer the multi-length scale structure of conjugated polymer networks. A detailed understanding is developed through structural characterization of each stage of the self-assembly process: dissolved polymer, semi-crystalline fiber, fibrillar branching and percolated network formation. Variations in self-assembly conditions were utilized to develop multi-length scale structure-property relationships. Furthermore, a new method to directly incorporate these fibrillar network structures into thin films for organic electronics is discussed. This dissertation will demonstrate our work towards understanding the mechanisms behind conjugated polymer self-assembly in order to provide robust design parameters that can be tuned to generate specific structures, occurring on multiple length scales, and relevant properties for a diversity of applications.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed December 9, 2014). 0aConjugated polymers. 0aSelf-assembly (Chemistry) 0aOrganic electronicsxMaterials. 0aThin films. 7aConjugated polymers.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01741276 7aSelf-assembly (Chemistry)2fast0(OCoLC)fst01111504 7aThin films.2fast0(OCoLC)fst011500180 aConjugated Polymer0 aMulti-Length Scale0 aNeutron Scattering0 aOrganic Electronics0 aSelf-Assembly 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 4aThesesxChemical engineering 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aPozzo, Lilo D.,edegree supervisor.40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/26503  aWAUW06074cam a2200589Ii 4500001001000000008004100010006001900051005001700070007001400087040007700101100002900178245009200207264006300299264001100362300007200373336002600445337002600471338003600497347002400533502004300557504005700600520388700657588009704544650003504641650003104676650002504707650002204732650001204754650001304766650001704779650002804796650001404824650003804838650004804876650003904924650004004963650005105003650004305054650005405097653001805151653001205169653001505181653001305196653001005209653002205219655004705241655003405288655002805322700008805350856003705438049000905475897820395141209t20142014waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20210721171420.9cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdWAUdOCLCAdOCLCFdOCLCQdOCLCOdOCLdWAUdOCLCO1 aMi, Luo,d1985-eauthor.10aMolecular engineering approaches against germs, spores and biofilm formation /cLuo Mi. 1a[Seattle] :b[University of Washington Libraries],c[2014] 4c©2014  a1 online resource (vii, 158 pages) :billustrations (chiefly color)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext filebPDF2rda  bPh.

In fact, the very subject has posed engineering challenges and incented scientific questioning for as long as the history of modern day microbiology and materials science themselves. With the rapid advances of molecular engineering in the past few decades, engineers as well as scientists are now equipped with new tools to study and solve these age-old problems. In the wake of these recent developments, the central goal of this thesis is essentially three-fold: first, to expand the existing zwitterionic nonfouling polymer platform for the search of novel and pragmatic solutions to bacterial surface adhesion and subsequent proliferation; second, to adopt a chemical biology approach to understand and potentially combat the extreme survivability of bacterial endospores; and lastly to explore the possible new routes and targets for future anti-virulence small molecules against biofilm formation. This dissertation is thus divided into these three sections accordingly: Traditional zwitterionic polymers have been widely accepted and routinely applied because of their biocompatibility and nonfouling property. However, less recognized are their responsiveness to environmental stimuli, their chemical malleability, their ease to be integrated into more complex systems as well as the biological significance of this polymer structural diversity. It is the intention to the first part of this dissertation to expand our current capacity and understanding of zwitterionic-based materials to cater to more complicated or more specific biomedical scenarios. Four aspects of molecular engineering were presented in this section: (1) first, to exploit the pH responsive property of traditional carboxylbetaine zwitterionic polymers for bacteria detection; (2) one step further, on a monomer level, to design novel hydrolysable zwitterionic molecules that are simultaneously nonfouling and antimicrobial; (3) on a polymeric level, to integrate an antimicrobial zwitterionic derivative portion into wound dressing block copolymers that can undergo both monomer hydrolysis as well as polymer temperature-induced in situ gelation; (4) and finally to investigate how different molecular structures impact zwitterionic polymer performance in complex biological environments, and, in particular, their interactions with bacterial extracellular polysaccharides (EPS). Bacterial endospores are among the most tenacious life forms on earth, and are highly resistant to traditional antibiotic compounds and disinfection procedures. For this reason, in the second part of this thesis, the focus was shifted from normal vegetative bacterial cells to dormant bacterial endospores: first, to unveil the mechanism behind spore extreme survivability by studying dodecylamine (DDA) lethal germination process as a model system; and second, to apply this newly acquired fundamental understanding in the design of new environmentally benign and easily implementable anti-spore strategies. Perhaps the most urgent challenge and threat facing clinical microbiology at the moment is the rapid emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains due to decades of extensive usage of antibiotic drugs. One promising strategy to circumvent this problem of rapid evolution under strong antibiotic selection pressure is the development of so-called "anti-virulence" drugs that seeks to disarm bacteria by limiting their virulent phenotypes instead of directly killing bacteria. The last part of this thesis explore the feasibility of using bacterial osmoprotectant analogues as such anti-virulence metabolites to interfere with glycine betaine homeostasis and potentially impair P.aeruginosa biofilm formation without causing a detrimental effect on planktonic bacterial cells.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed December 9, 2014). 0aPolyzwitterionsxMicrobiology. 0aPolyzwitterionsxSurfaces. 0aFoulingxPrevention. 0aBacterial spores. 0aAmines. 0aBetaine. 0aHomeostasis. 0aPseudomonas aeruginosa. 0aBiofilms. 7aAmines.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00807596 7aBacterial spores.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01716025 7aBetaine.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01749156 7aBiofilms.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00832066 7aFoulingxPrevention.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00933252 7aHomeostasis.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00959606 7aPseudomonas aeruginosa.2fast0(OCoLC)fst010808810 aAntibacterial0 aBiofilm0 aNonfouling0 aPolymers0 aSpore0 aSurface Chemistry 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 4aThesesxChemical engineering. 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aJiang, Shaoyi,d1964-edegree supervisor.1http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q8856592040uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/26507  aWAUW03662cam a2200373Ii 4500001001000000008004100010006001900051005001700070007001400087040005300101066000700154100003800161245017300199264006300372264001100435300007000446336002600516337002600542338003600568347002400604502004300628504005700671588009700728653001300825653002100838653002700859655003400886655004700920655002800967700004500995856003701040880220201077049000903279900894585150128t20142014waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20190611065407.9cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdWAUdOCLCQdOCLCOdOCLCF  c(S1 aMcDonald, Timothy James,eauthor.10aCharacterization and modeling of La{1-x}Sr{x}CoO{3-delta} solid oxide fuel cell cathodes using nonlinear electrochemical impedance techniques /cTimothy James McDonald. 1a[Seattle] :b[University of Washington Libraries],c[2014] 4c©2014  a1 online resource (v, 136 pages) :billustrations (chiefly color)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext filebPDF2rda  bPh.

There are however significant challenges preventing the wide spread commercialization of SOFCs. Of primary concern is the high costs associated with high temperature operation, and reduced performance in the desired intermediate temperature regime. Mixed ionic and electronic conducting materials, such as La[subscript1-x]Sr[subscript x]CoO[subscript 3-δ], offer increased performance for oxygen reduction due to their ability to transport oxygen ions and extend the active region of the electrode beyond the electrode/electrolyte interface. This work primarily explores two aspects of SOFC cathode performance (using the mixed conductor La[subscript 1-x]Sr[subscript x]CoO[subscript 3-δ] as a model electrode material) the affects of inhomogeneous cation compositions on the surface exchange rate and the effects of humidity on electrode performance and behavior. Inhomogeneous compositions are explored by studying the electrochemical response of well characterized highly-crystalline, thin-film, microelectrodes using both linear and nonlinear electrochemical spectroscopy. A dual surface/dual bulk compositional model is used to characterize the main affects of both lateral (parallel to the surface) and axial (perpendicular to the surface) compositional variations. Humidity effects are also studied using linear and nonlinear electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, but on porous electrodes, for which a 1-dimensional, dual transport, altered surface thermodynamic model is used to characterize the observed effects. Finally a new electrochemical technique called Simultaneous Chemical and Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (SCEIS) is proposed which uses dual perturbations to elicit more detailed information about currently indistinguishable co-limiting processes occurring within mixed-conducting porous electrodes. Initial experimental work on assessing the feasibility of such an experiment is reported.  aWAUW02942cam a2200457Ii 4500001001000000008004100010006001900051005001700070007001400087040008100101100003500182245007000217264006300287264001100350300007200361336002600433337002600459338003600485347002400521502004800545504005500593520123100648588009501879650003001974650001902004650002702023650004502050650005602095650005302151653002102204653001702225653001402242653001802256653001602274655003302290655004702323655002802370700004002398856003702438049000902475905547286150324t20142014waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20190525172000.5cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdOCLCOdOCLCAdOCLCQdOCLCOdWAUdOCLCFdOCLCQdOCLCO1 aLombardo, Michael T.,eauthor.10aSelf-assembly of nanoparticle surfactants /cMichael T.

Nanoparticles are one type of building block and have gained interest recently due to their unique optical and electrical properties which have proved useful in fields such as energy, catalysis, and advanced materials. There are several techniques currently used to self-assemble nanoparticles, each with its own set of benefits and drawbacks. Here, we address the limited number of techniques in non-polar solvents by introducing a method utilizing amphiphilic gold nanoparticles. Grafted polymer chains provide steric stabilization while small hydrophilic molecules induce assembly through short range attractive forces. The properties of these self-assembled structures are found to be dependent on the polymer and small molecules surface concentrations and chemistries. These particles act as nanoparticle surfactants and can effectively stabilize oil-water interfaces, such as in an emulsion. In addition to the work in organic solvent, similar amphiphilic particles in aqueous media are shown to effectively stabilize oil-in-water emulsions that show promise as photoacoustic/ultrasound theranostic agents.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed March 24, 2015). 0aSelf-assembly (Chemistry) 0aNanoparticles. 0aSurface active agents. 7aNanoparticles.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01032624 7aSelf-assembly (Chemistry)2fast0(OCoLC)fst01111504 7aSurface active agents.2fast0(OCoLC)fst011391970 aInverse emulsion0 aNanoparticle0 aPlasmonic0 aSelf-Assembly0 aTheranostic 4aThesesxChemical engineering 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aPozzo, Lilo D.,edegree supervisor.40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/27429  aWAUW03735cam a2200445Ii 4500001001000000008004100010006001900051005001700070007001400087040008100101100002800182245011400210264006300324264001100387300007100398336002600469337002600495338003600521347002400557502004300581504005600624520194300680588009502623650004502718650004302763650002402806650002702830650006902857650007102926653001402997653002603011653002203037653003303059655003303092655004703125655002803172700004303200856003703243049000903280905028424150317t20142014waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20190525172309.4cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdOCLCOdOCLCAdOCLCQdOCLCOdWAUdOCLCFdOCLCQdOCLCO1 aHu, Bo,d1984-eauthor.10aMetabolic engineering of the ethylmalonyl-CoA pathway in M. extorquens AM1 for 1-butanol production /cBo Hu. 1a[Seattle] :b[University of Washington Libraries],c[2014] 4c©2014  a1 online resource (xi, 104 pages) :billustrations (chiefly color)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext filebPDF2rda  bPh.

However, several fundamental questions involving how metabolic pathways are regulated and how they function as a system remained unsolved, which impedes progress in the metabolic engineering of M. extorquens AM1. This work is a compilation of efforts aiming to address initial issues related to the metabolic engineering of M. extorquens AM1 and establish a synthetic 1-butanol pathway as a proof of principle case. First, we investigated and characterized the effect of a tetR-type regulator (CcrR) on the expression of ccr, a critical gene of the EMC pathway, a key target for metabolic engineering. Furthermore, to demonstrate the potential of M. extorquens AM1 as a future industrial microorganism, a 1-butanol synthesis pathway was established in M. extorquens AM1 by diverting part of the native crotonyl-CoA flux from the EMC pathway to 1-butanol production. Engineered strains demonstrated different 1-butanol production using ethylamine as a substrate, and optimization was carried out. Finally, adaptive laboratory evolution was used as a tool to develop M. extorquens AM1 for high 1-butanol tolerance. We applied a serial transfer method to isolate two mutants that demonstrated improved 1-butanol tolerance compared to the parent strain. Whole genome sequencing of evolved strains revealed mutations that may be responsible for the observed phenotype. Our success in producing 1-butanol from the engineered M. extorquens AM1 opens the possibility for using methylotrophs for bulk chemical production. In addition, the collected information from this research will provide useful guidance for metabolic engineering of M. extorquens AM1 as an industrial platform in the future.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed March 17, 2015). 0aMethylobacterium extorquensxMetabolism. 0aMethylobacterium extorquensxGenetics. 0aButanolxSynthesis. 0aCoenzymesxMetabolism. 7aMethylobacterium extorquensxGenetics.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01202276 7aMethylobacterium extorquensxMetabolism.2fast0(OCoLC)fst017661030 a1-butanol0 aMetabolic engineering0 aM. extorquens AM10 aThe ethylmalonyl-CoA pathway 4aThesesxChemical engineering 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aLidstrom, Mary E.,edegree supervisor.40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/27430  aWAUW02812cam a2200385Ii 4500001001000000008004100010006001900051005001700070007001400087040008600101100004400187245010800231264006300339264001100402300006600413336002600479337002600505338003600531347002400567502004100591504005500632520128200687588009501969650003902064650002402103650001402127650005002141650004002191655003302231655004702264655002802311700004102339856003702380049000902417904967676150316t20142014waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20190525173526.6cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdWAUdOCLCOdOCLCAdOCLCQdOCLCOdWAUdOCLCFdOCLCQdOCLCO1 aHoffmann, Stephanie M.,d1990-eauthor.10aMolecular dynamics simulations of poly(3-hexylthiophenes) in dilute solutions /cStephanie M.

As compared with traditional devices, polymer-based electronic devices are cheaper, lighter, and more easily processed. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation is a useful tool for the study of these polymers because it allows us to probe structural properties at a length scale unobtainable by current experimental techniques. Using MD simulations, poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) was studied in multiple solvents to probe the effect of solvation on structural properties. Additionally, poly(3-alkylthiophenes) (P3ATs) with side chains varying from two to twelve carbons in length were studied to determine the effect side chain length on these same properties. P3HT was found to have more flexibility in chlorinated solvents, chloroform and dichlorobenzene, than in the other solvents studied. Analysis of the pairwise distribution functions suggests these differences may arise due to the differences in the polymer-solvent interactions. In the case of varying side chain lengths, a counterintuitive inverse proportionality relationship was found between persistence lengths and conjugation lengths. A variety of analyses were unable to illuminate the underlying reason for this inverse relationship.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed March 16, 2015). 0aPoly(3-hexylthiophene)xStructure. 0aMolecular dynamics. 0aSolvents. 7aMolecular dynamics.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01024778 7aSolvents.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01125677 4aThesesxChemical engineering 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aPfaendtner, Jim,edegree supervisor.40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/27432  aWAUW03325cam a2200481Ii 4500001001000000008004100010006001900051005001700070007001400087040005800101100002800159245011800187264006300305264001100368300006700379336002600446337002600472338003600498347002400534502004300558504005700601588009800658520146500756650002802221650002402249650002802273650001602301650005002317650005402367650004202421650005402463653003202517653002102549653001602570653003002586653002702616655004702643655003402690655002802724700004502752856003702797049000902834899089623141231t20142014waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20190926214226.7cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdWAUdOCLCFdOCLCQdOCLCOdOCL1 aGeary, Tim C.,eauthor.10aLanthanum ferrite-based mixed-conducting electrodes for solid oxide fuel cells and electrolyzers /cTim C.

However, the phenomena limiting performance of the associated oxygen and fuel electrodes are poorly understood, particularly for the class of mixed ionic and electronic conducting (MIEC) electrodes gaining interest for their performance and stability. This work investigates thermodynamic, kinetic, and transport processes affecting the performance of La₀.₉Ca₀.₁FeO₃-[delta] (LCF) and La₀.₆Sr₀.₄Co₀.₂Fe₀.O₃[delta] (LSCF) electrodes. Thermodynamic measurements on LCF reveal semiconducting behavior across a wide range of temperature and oxygen partial pressure, while also showing stability in both oxidizing and reducing conditions. Linear and nonlinear electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS, NLEIS) were used to identify rate-limiting processes occurring on LCF and LSCF cells in oxygen by comparison with porous electrode models. In both cases, results suggest the electrode surface to play a dominant role, behaving more reduced than expected from bulk measurements. Additionally, impedance measurements of LCF-91 electrodes in reducing hydrogen-water environments highlight the difficulties, both thermodynamic and transport-related, that arise when studying n-type MIECs under these conditions. 0aSolid oxide fuel cells. 0aElectrolytic cells. 0aFuel cellsxElectrodes. 0aPerovskite. 7aElectrolytic cells.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00906497 7aFuel cellsxElectrodes.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00935860 7aPerovskite.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01058323 7aSolid oxide fuel cells.2fast0(OCoLC)fst011254200 aElectrochemical engineering0 aMixed conductors0 aPerovskites0 aSolid oxide electrolyzers0 aSolid oxide fuel cells 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 4aThesesxChemical engineering. 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aAdler, Stuart Blake,edegree supervisor.40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/26168  aWAUW04433cam a2200505Ii 4500001001000000008004100010006001900051005001700070007001400087040005800101100003000159245011100189264006300300264001100363300006900374336002600443337002600469338003600495347002400531502004300555500001000598504004100608520252900649588009903178650002703277650002503304650001703329650002803346650005303374650005103427650005403478650004303532653002103575653002403596653003403620653002603654653002403680653002403704655004703728655003403775655002803809700004403837856003703881049000903918890665441140916t20142014waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20190926201727.5cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdWAUdOCLCFdOCLCQdOCLCOdOCL1 aEarmme, Taeshik,eauthor.10aStudies of solution-processed organic light-emitting diodes and all-polymer solar cells /cTaeshik Earmme. 1a[Seattle] :b[University of Washington Libraries],c[2014] 4c©2014  a1 online resource (xiv, 222 pages) :billustrations (some color)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext filebPDF2rda  bPh.

Over the past two decades, organic electronics has gained enormous attention due to its many advantages, including low power consumption, low-cost, scalable, and flexible design. Development of high-performance devices by designing new materials and related device engineering is crucial to the future advances in organic electronics. This dissertation focuses on studies of two classes of optoelectronic devices, organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) and all-polymer solar cells, fabricated by solution-processing of organic semiconductors, and aims to better understand structure-property-performance relationships resulting from solution-based fabrication. Study of bisindenoanthrazolines and dendritic oligoquinolines were found to be promising new electron-transport materials (ETMs) for high-performance phosphorescent OLEDs (PhOLEDs). Solution-processed multilayered blue PhOLEDs with orthogonal solution-processed ETMs were found to have the highest efficiency (luminous efficiency = 28.3 cd/A and external quantum efficiency = 15.5 %) observed to date among polymer-based devices. The surface morphology and charge-transport properties of the ETMs were successfully tuned by solution-deposition, which made it possible to eliminate the need for interfacial materials and low work function metals commonly used as cathode materials in OLEDs. High-performance solution-processed PhOLEDs using commercial ETMs were also demonstrated using orthogonal solution-processing. The bulk conductivity and charge transport properties of ETMs were enhanced by a novel solution n-doping with alkali metal salts. Sulfone- and dibenzosuberane-based materials were demonstrated as promising new classes of ETMs that possess high triplet energies (> 2.8 - 3.0 eV). Multilayered PhOLEDs with a solution-processed blue triplet emission layer using high triplet energy ETMs as an electron-transport layer were found to have significantly improved performance, including high current efficiency and external quantum efficiency (~ 20 %). Finally, solution-processed polymer/polymer blend solar cells using new naphthalene diimide-based acceptor copolymers were investigated and found to be the most efficient all-polymer solar cells reported to date. Controlling polymer blend morphology by solution-processing from a co-solvent system also led to further enhancement of device performance.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed September 16, 2014). 0aLight emitting diodes. 0aOrganic electronics. 0aSolar cells. 0aOrganic semiconductors. 7aLight emitting diodes.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00998542 7aOrganic electronics.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01047687 7aOrganic semiconductors.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01047724 7aSolar cells.2fast0(OCoLC)fst011249320 aCharge Transport0 aOrganic Electronics0 aOrganic Light-Emitting Diodes0 aOrganic Photovoltaics0 aPolymer Solar Cells0 aSolution Processing 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 4aThesesxChemical engineering. 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aJenekhe, Samson A.,edegree supervisor.40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/25366  aWAUW03204cam a2200457Ii 4500001001000000008004100010006001900051005001700070007001400087040005800101100003800159245009200197246008900289264006300378264001100441300007200452336002600524337002600550338003600576347002400612502004300636504005500679520137800734588009702112650006202209650002802271650004502299650007102344650005402415653001502469653001702484653002302501653001302524653001302537655004702550655003402597655002802631700004102659856003702700049000902737894136896141031t20142014waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20190927055123.9cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdWAUdOCLCFdOCLCQdOCLCOdOCL1 aDeighan, Michael,d1987-eauthor.10aSimulating protein adsorption phenomena for experimental comparison /cMichael Deighan.1 iTitle from abstract page:aSimulating protein adsorption for experimental comparison 1a[Seattle] :b[University of Washington Libraries],c[2014] 4c©2014  a1 online resource (viii, 92 pages) :billustrations (chiefly color)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext filebPDF2rda  bPh.

Generally, we know that proteins experience some degree of conformational change at the solid/liquid interface, and can measure these changes in the lab. However, while many experimental techniques exist for characterizing surface-bound proteins, none have been able to resolve high-precision structures. Computer simulation offers a unique route to determining how proteins adsorb. Herein, we apply a popular statistical sampling technique - Parallel Tempering Metadynamics - to all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of explicitly solvated proteins interacting with solid surfaces. We show that by biasing specific degrees of freedom - or collective variables - a protein can be influenced to exhaustively explore conformational space both on and off a surface. The results from these simulations can be post-processed to reveal details such as: surface-bound conformations, orientations, and finer structural details like interatomic distances and Ramachandran angles - which, in turn, can be compared to, and validated by, experimental measurements. Ultimately, this work should convey the descriptive power that can arise from a mutually beneficial partnership between surface science and computer simulation in the context of biomolecular adsorption.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed October 31, 2014). 0aProteinsxAbsorption and adsorptionxComputer simulation. 0aProteinsxConformation. 0aMolecular dynamicsxComputer simulation. 7aMolecular dynamicsxComputer simulation.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01024779 7aProteinsxConformation.2fast0(OCoLC)fst010797250 aAdsorption0 aMetadynamics0 aMolecular Dynamics0 aProteins0 aSampling 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 4aThesesxChemical engineering. 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aPfaendtner, Jim,edegree supervisor.40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/26504  aWAUW03183cam a2200529Ii 4500001001000000008004100010006001900051005001700070007001400087040005800101100003800159245009500197264006300292264001100355300006400366336002600430337002600456338003600482347002400518502004300542504005700585520121400642588009701856650002101953650002201974650002801996650002202024650001402046650001402060650002202074650004802096650004002144650004002184650004702224650005402271650004802325653002102373653003602394653001302430653001102443655004702454655003402501655002802535700004402563856003702607049000902644894129984141031t20142014waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20190927055058.2cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdWAUdOCLCFdOCLCQdOCLCOdOCL1 aCoyle, Brandon Laurence,eauthor.10aSolid-binding proteins for modification of inorganic substrates /cBrandon Laurence Coyle. 1a[Seattle] :b[University of Washington Libraries],c[2014] 4c©2014  a1 online resource (131 pages) :billustrations (some color)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext filebPDF2rda  bPh.

In this work, we identify a new set of carbon binding peptides that vary in overall hydrophobicity and charge, and engineer two of these sequences (Car9 and Car15) within the framework of various proteins to exploit their binding ability. In addition, we conducted a detailed analysis of the mechanisms that underpin the interaction of the fusion proteins with carbon and silicon surfaces. Through these insights, we were able to develop proteins suitable for dispersing graphene flakes and carbon nanotubes in aqueous solutions, while retaining protein activity. Additionally, our investigation into the mechanisms of adhesion for our carbon binding peptides inspired a cheap, disposable protein purification system that is more than 10x cheaper than commonly used His-tag protein purification. Our results emphasize the importance of understanding both bulk and molecular recognition events when exploiting the adhesive properties of solid-binding peptides and proteins in technological applications.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed October 31, 2014). 0aProtein binding. 0aCarbonxSurfaces. 0aProteinsxPurification. 0aSilicaxSurfaces. 0aGraphene. 0aPeptides. 0aCarbon nanotubes. 7aCarbon nanotubes.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01896549 7aGraphene.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01746494 7aPeptides.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01057564 7aProtein binding.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01079673 7aProteinsxPurification.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01079750 7aSilicaxSurfaces.2fast0(OCoLC)fst011185950 aCarbon Nanotubes0 aDisposable protein purification0 aGraphene0 aSilica 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 4aThesesxChemical engineering. 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aBaneyx, François,edegree supervisor.40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/26505  aWAUW04573cam a2200589Ii 4500001001000000008004100010006001900051005001700070007001400087040006500101100003600166245013000202264006300332264001100395300006700406336002600473337002600499338003600525347002400561502004300585504004100628588009900669520212800768650004802896650003602944650001502980650001802995650002703013650006503040650004903105650006703154650007003221650005003291650006003341650007403401650004403475650005303519650004103572650006203613653001803675653001703693653002303710653001803733653002203751653001203773655004703785655003403832655002803866700004303894856003703937049000903974890665801140916t20142014waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20200325021800.4cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdWAUdOCLCFdOCLCQdOCLCOdOCLdOCLCA1 aChen, Helen C.,d1986-eauthor.10aControl of endosomal toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling by nanoparticles and applications in cancer therapy /cHelen C.

TLRs 3 and 9 are expressed in endosomal and lysosomal compartments and recognize nucleic acids. The activation of TLRs 3 and 9 leads to two distinct signaling pathways resulting in the nuclear translocation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-[kappa] B) and interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF-7). The NF-[kappa] B and IRF-7 pathways induce pro-inflammatory cytokines (such as IL-6) and type I interferons (IFNs such as IFN-[alpha]), respectively. Pro-inflammatory cytokines are associated with tumorigenesis, whereas type I IFNs can induce anticancer effects. In this work, the effects of biomaterial size and composition on the cytokine secretion profile of cells were studied. The effect of biomaterial size was evaluated by adsorbing TLR9 ligands onto micro- and sub-micro polystyrene particles. The cytokine profile was correlated with the pH of endosomes and lysosomes that internalized particles of different sizes were exposed to. The effect of biomaterial composition was evaluated by incorporating TLR3 and TLR9 ligands into polymer blend nanoparticles of precise polymer compositions. The polymer composition could be tuned to induce distinct cytokine profiles. Interestingly, the terpolymer blend was able to present TLR ligands in a manner that resulted in IFN-[alpha] induction only. Such control of TLR signaling provided the motivation for applications in breast cancer therapy. The efficacy of terpolymer blend particles containing TLR ligands was assessed for triple negative breast cancer cell lines. The treatment efficacy was determined by effects on cell proliferation, cell death, cell migration, and cell expression of CD44, a marker for a metastastic phenotype. TLR9 ligands encapsulated in terpolymer particles were not an effective treatment for both MDA-MB-231 and BT-20 cell lines. TLR3 ligands encapsulated in terpolymer particles were the most effective treatment for BT-20 cells, but were ineffective for MDA-MB-231 cells. The treatment efficacy was correlated with the level of type I IFNs. 0aBiomedical materialsxPhysiological effect. 0aPolymersxPhysiological effect. 0aCytokines. 0aCancer cells. 0aCancerxImmunotherapy. 2aBiocompatible Materialsxpharmacology.0(DNLM)D001672Q000494 2aCytokinesxmetabolism.0(DNLM)D016207Q000378 2aOligodeoxyribonucleotidesxpharmacology.0(DNLM)D009838Q000494 2aInterferon Regulatory Factor-7ximmunology.0(DNLM)D050839Q000276 2aPolymersxpharmacology.0(DNLM)D011108Q000494 2aToll-Like Receptor 9ximmunology.0(DNLM)D051217Q000276 7aBiomedical materialsxPhysiological effect.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00832594 7aCancer cells.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00845563 7aCancerxImmunotherapy.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00845386 7aCytokines.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00886268 7aPolymersxPhysiological effect.2fast0(OCoLC)fst010706330 aImmunotherapy0 aInflammation0 aTissue engineering0 aTumorigenesis0 aType I interferon0 aVaccine 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 4aThesesxChemical engineering. 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aShen, Hong,d1972-edegree supervisor.40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/25368  aWAUW03864cam a2200577Ii 4500001001000000008004100010006001900051005001700070007001400087040005800101100003300159245009600192264006300288264001100351300006200362336002600424337002600450338003600476347002400512502004300536500001000579504005600589520179500645588009702440650002102537650001702558650002402575650001302599650001202612650001502624650001202639650004102651650003902692650003802731650004302769650004702812650003802859650005002897653001702947653002802964653002302992653002903015653002403044653002203068655004703090655003403137655002803171700004103199856003703240049000903277893875335141027t20142014waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20190927050837.6cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdWAUdOCLCFdOCLCQdOCLCOdOCL1 aBurney, Patrick R.,eauthor.10aModeling protein stability and structural preference in ionic liquids /cPatrick R.

However, many of the known ionic liquids show little to no support for enzyme activity and many cases have been demonstrated where structurally and functionally similar enzymes exhibit discrepant retention of activity in ionic liquids. Although many experimental investigations have attempted to formulate rules that predict enzyme tolerance to ionic liquids, there are few rules that apply broadly. Molecular dynamics is a computational technique that is well suited to provide atomistic insight about the nature and effects of ionic liquid / enzyme interactions. This research has involved development and application of simulation methodology and analysis toward investigating these complex interactions as well as the structural stability of multiple enzymes in ionic liquids. Application of these techniques has indicated that the nature of enzyme deactivation by ionic liquids is just as complicated as the experimental results have suggested; different enzymes and different ionic liquids show indications of competitive inhibition by the solvent or destabilization. Through several independent studies we have observed and described: the dampening of enzyme fluctuations in high concentrations of ionic liquids; the organization of water and ionic liquid substituents about enzymes; and the loss of secondary structure that precedes denaturing and possibly enzyme aggregation. In recognition that future studies in this area will also need to go beyond classical MD simulations, we have applied special multiscale modeling techniques to a separate protein system to quantify how mutations induce changes in the preferred structural state of an important protein fragment.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed October 27, 2014). 0aIonic solutions. 0aFused salts. 0aMolecular dynamics. 0aEnzymes. 0aLipase. 0aCellulase. 0aFibrin. 7aCellulase.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00850323 7aEnzymes.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00913605 7aFibrin.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00923659 7aFused salts.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00936680 7aIonic solutions.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00978618 7aLipase.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00999359 7aMolecular dynamics.2fast0(OCoLC)fst010247780 aBiocatalysis0 aBiochemical simulations0 aMolecular dynamics0 aNon-aqueous biocatalysis0 aProtein engineering0 aProtein structure 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 4aThesesxChemical engineering. 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aPfaendtner, Jim,edegree supervisor.40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/26506  aWAUW05390cam a2200421Ii 4500001001000000008004100010006001900051005001700070007001400087040006500101100003200166245010600198264006300304264001100367300007000378336002600448337002600474338003600500347002400536502004300560500001000603504005700613520381200670588009904482650003104581650002704612653001904639653001204658653001604670653002204686653001704708655003404725655004704759655002804806700008804834856003704922049000904959890665909140916t20142014waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20210721171741.7cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdWAUdOCLCQdOCLCOdOCLCFdWAUdOCLCO1 aBrault, Norman D.,eauthor.10aMultifunctional zwitterionic surface chemistry for applications in complex media /cNorman D.

Due to the complexity of human blood plasma and serum, the most common sources for biomarker analysis, current attempts to integrate existing biosensing assays with analyte detection has resulted in two major shortcomings: high rates of false-positives, from non-specific binding, and a lack of assay sensitivity, due to low ligand loading. Taken together, these two factors indicate that a high signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) is vital for achieving sensitive biomarker-based diagnostics. Furthermore, a single material that can (1) exhibit non-fouling properties from undiluted human blood, (2) present abundant and easily functionalizable chemical groups for ligand attachment, and (3) possesses high immobilization capacities, would offer the most promising approach to achieving this goal. Such idealities were addressed using zwitterionic poly(carboxybetaine) (pCB) surface chemistry. First, an important parameter was realized for identifying surface coatings suitable for real-world applications involving undiluted complex media. It was found that ultra low fouling properties using a thin film is possible if it is densely packed. While such prevention of non-specific adsorption is important, the detection of biomarkers also hinges on the ability to immobilize biologically active ligands all while maintaining the original ultra low fouling background noise of the surface coating. Hence, the dual-functionality of pCB, which provides both protein resistance and ligand functionalization, was then applied to protein arrays. Here, uniform spot morphology as well as excellent non-fouling properties following antibody immobilization was achieved. This enabled improvements in the sensitivity for multiplexed detection of target analytes directly from undiluted human plasma. As even the best non-fouling background combined with the highest affinity ligand would still have a limited S/N ratio due to the 2-dimensional (2-D) structure of polymer films, two efforts to improve the "signal" component were also investigated. The first method led to the development of a hierarchical architecture consisting of a thin and highly dense first layer and a loose but controlled second layer, for low fouling and high ligand loading, respectively. The second approach for improving biomarker assay performance involved taking advantage of new biosensor devices. Such novel sensor designs exhibit decreasing surface dimensions with unique geometries and enhanced theoretical sensitivities. Due to these distinct characteristics, the development of a dual-functional "graft-to" surface coating was necessary. Here, the conjugation of the adhesive molecule DOPA with pCB enabled the successful attachment to a biosensor surface while also demonstrating ultra low fouling and functionalization properties. This "graft-to" technology can be readily extended to other device platforms. Finally, while normal immobilization conditions for pCB allow for the attachment of acidic and neutrally charged ligands, two strategies for expanding the range of ligands, to include basic proteins (i.e. with high isoelectric points), which can be coupled to an ultra low fouling zwitterionic background were also investigated. It was found that the use of reversible citraconic anhydride protection enabled the coupling of the highly basic protein lysozyme to the pCB surface. The second strategy, involving a novel zwitterionic ultra low fouling material, led to an initial characterization which indicated promising results. In summary, this work represents a multifunctional zwitterionic surface chemistry readily suitable for applications in undiluted complex media.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed September 16, 2014). 0aPolyzwitterionsxSurfaces. 0aBiosensorsxMaterials.0 aCarboxybetaine0 aFouling0 aHuman blood0 aSurface chemistry0 aZwitterionic 4aThesesxChemical engineering. 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aJiang, Shaoyi,d1964-edegree supervisor.1http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q8856592040uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/25369  aWAUW02761cam a2200445Ii 4500001001000000008004100010006001900051005001700070007001400087040007000101100002900171245009900200264006300299264001100362300006300373336002600436337002600462338003600488347002400524502004100548504005500589520106600644588009801710650002701808650002801835650004001863650005401903650005301957653002302010653004302033653002402076653000802100653000802108655003302116655004702149655002802196700004502224856003702269049000902306932529678151217t20152015waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20190626172451.5cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdacWAUdOCLCAdOCLCQdOCLCOdWAUdOCLCFdOCLCQdOCLCO1 aZou, Changlong,eauthor.10aImplementation of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy on the mobile phone /cChanglong Zou. 1a[Seattle] :b[University of Washington Libraries],c[2015] 4c©2015  a1 online resource (68 pages) :billustrations (some color)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext filebPDF2rda  bM.S.cUniversity of Washingtond2015  aIncludes bibliographical references (pages 64-68).3 aLithium-ion batteries are widely used in portable devices, household electronics, and transportation vehicles. Accurately estimating the state of charge (SOC), state of health (SOH), and remaining usable lifetime (RUL) of Li-ion batteries is increasingly important. New diagnostic method are needed to improve battery management and performance. Here we review electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) based SOC and SOH estimation methods. We then introduce a new method to do EIS on portable devices. We show that screen brightness modulations can be used to produce a modulated current at the battery. The modulated current induces a modulated voltage signal. Fast Fourier Transforms (FFTs) of the current and voltage signals are used to determine the battery impedance at the modulation frequency. An Android application is used to control the screen modulation and make the current and voltage measurements on the phone. The prototype EIS application is demonstrated as a potentially valuable new characterization tool for on-device battery diagnostics.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed December 17, 2015). 0aLithium ion batteries. 0aImpedance spectroscopy. 0aCell phonesxBatteriesxEvaluation. 7aImpedance spectroscopy.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00968092 7aLithium ion batteries.2fast0(OCoLC)fst017646400 aBattery diagnostic0 aElectrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy0 aLithium ion battery0 aSOC0 aSOH 4aThesesxChemical engineering 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aSchwartz, Daniel T.,edegree supervisor.40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/33643  aWAUW04070cam a2200361Ii 4500001001000000008004100010006001900051005001700070007001400087040005800101100002500159245012900184264006300313264001100376300007900387336002600466337002600492338003600518347002400554502004300578504005700621500000900678520264400687588009403331650003503425650004903460655003403509655004703543655002803590700004403618856003703662049000903699945931629160404t20152015waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20190605182849.9cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdWAUdOCLCFdWAUdOCLCQdOCLCO1 aZhu, Leize,eauthor.10aEfficient, low-cost organic-inorganic hybrid solar cells via materials, interface, and device structure design /cLeize Zhu. 1a[Seattle] :b[University of Washington Libraries],c[2015] 4c©2015  a1 online resource (xviii, 158 pages, III) :billustrations (chiefly color)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext filebPDF2rda  bPh.

The commonly used materials are lack of strong absorption in the near-infrared region. Pyrite FeS₂ is a promising material because of its high absorption in the range of 300-1100 nm. In addition, it is abundant, non-toxic and has long term stability as well as the extraordinary electrical properties. Pyrite FeS₂ hierarchical microparticles consisting of cubic crystals with defined {100} faceted textures were synthesized using a hydrothermal method with the presence of ethylenediamine and polyvinylpyrrolidone. Short, branched, and chromosome-like pyrite FeS₂ rods with a diameter of 10 nm and a length of 20-30 nm as well as quasi-cubic NC agglomerates with a size of 200 nm were obtained by hot injection methods. The growth of anisotropic iron pyrite nanocrystals (NCs) follows the oriented attachment mechanism at the early growth stage of the hot injection synthesis followed by Ostwald ripening mechanism as time progresses. In the fabrication of inverted organic-inorganic hybrid solar cells with pyrite NCs, we realize an effective hole transport layer (HTL) improves the performance of the solar cells and provides additional protection against water and oxygen. The HTL serves as a selective contact by extracting holes while concurrently blocking electrons, thereby reducing dark (leakage) current and enhancing the open circuit voltage (VOC), short circuit current (JSC), and fill factor (FF). The inverted hybrid CdSe -polymer solar cells with the poly (3, 4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-poly (styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/MoO₃ dual HTLs showed superior performance over those with a single HTL of PEDOT:PSS or MoO₃. The enhancement in electron transport in the active layer, the improvement in hole extraction at active layer/anode interface as well as a prevention of leakage current account for the enhancement in the efficiency of the solar cells with dual HTLs. In order to achieve an efficient charge separation and correlates the film morphology and grain size with the device performance. A two-step solution process with thermal plus solvent vapor-assisted thermal annealing was developed for the fabrication of binary Pb-Sn triiodine perovskite films. This was an effective method to make films with large and smooth grains. Using this new process to control and manipulate film morphology, grain size, and especially the distribution of metal cations in binary metal perovskite layers, opens an avenue to grow perovskite materials with desired properties to enhance device performance.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed April 4, 2016). 0aHybrid solar cellsxMaterials. 0aHybrid solar cellsxDesign and construction. 4aThesesxChemical engineering. 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aYu, Qiuming,d1963-edegree supervisor.40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/35146  aWAUW04070cam a2200421Ii 4500001001000000008004100010006001900051005001700070007001400087040007000101100003500171245011000206264006300316264001100379300006800390336002600458337002600484338003600510347002400546502004300570504005700613520238200670588009803052650002203150650002403172650002603196650002603222650005203248650005003300650004803350650005203398655003303450655004703483655002803530700004403558856003703602049000903639932530010151217t20152015waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20190626172433.4cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdacWAUdOCLCAdOCLCQdOCLCOdWAUdOCLCFdOCLCQdOCLCO1 aZhang, Weiran,d1987-eauthor.10aSignal peptide and chaperone engineering for secretion and excretion in Escherichia coli /cWeiran Zhang. 1a[Seattle] :b[University of Washington Libraries],c[2015] 4c©2015  a1 online resource (ix, 133 pages) :billustrations (some color)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext filebPDF2rda  bPh.

They may be found in a soluble form in the periplasm (the interstitial space between inner and outer membranes), integrated within the outer membrane or excreted outside of the cell in a vesicular or globular form. In all cases, they must first translocate across the inner membrane. A substantial fraction of secretory proteins do so by making use of a cleavable N-terminal extension called signal sequence (or peptide) that is recognized by a dedicated translocation system known as the Sec pathway. Typical Sec-dependent signal sequences have a tripartite structure with a central hydrophobic core and are about 20 residues in length. However, certain secretory proteins implicated in virulence employ Sec-dependent signal peptides that are over 40 residues long. To determine if repetition of canonical, Sec-dependent signal peptides would benefit secretory protein production, we fused the signal sequences of E. carotovora PelB and E. coli OmpA to one another to produce synthetic PelB-OmpA and OmpA-PelB leader peptides. Using periplasmic maltose binding protein (MBP) and outer membrane protein A (OmpA) as model systems, we found that dual signal peptides support Sec-dependent protein translocation and are preferentially cleaved at the signal peptidase I site vicinal to the mature protein. In the case of native OmpA, dual signal peptides increased the requirement for the molecular chaperone Trigger Factor but reduced the accumulation of misfolded precursor and mature species and delayed the acquisition of PBAD promoter mutations that restore cell growth by shutting down recombinant protein synthesis. On the other hand, dual signal sequences did not improve the incorporation of an OmpA1-183-mCherry fusion protein within extracellular outer membrane vesicles (OMVs), as highest yields were obtained with the PelB signal peptide. However, co-expression of periplasmic chaperones (primarily SurA) and components of the outer membrane protein assembly machinery (primarily BamA) improve OMV production by nearly twofold. Overall, our results highlight the potential and limitations of signal sequence and chaperone engineering strategies for the production of secretory proteins and OMVs in E. coli.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed December 17, 2015). 0aEscherichia coli. 0aBacterial proteins. 0aBacterial cell walls. 0aMolecular chaperones. 7aBacterial cell walls.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00825190 7aBacterial proteins.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00825235 7aEscherichia coli.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00915160 7aMolecular chaperones.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01024760 4aThesesxChemical engineering 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aBaneyx, François,edegree supervisor.40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/33647  aWAUW02783cam a2200421Ii 4500001001000000008004100010006001900051005001700070007001400087040007000101100003900171245010300210264006300313264001100376300007200387336002600459337002600485338003600511347002400547502004300571504005500614520110100669588009801770650003201868650003701900650002801937650003201965650005801997650006302055653002002118653002602138655003302164655004702197655002802244700004302272856003702315049000902352932358459151216t20152015waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20190625172439.4cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdacWAUdOCLCAdOCLCQdOCLCOdWAUdOCLCFdOCLCQdOCLCO1 aSmith, Amanda Lee,d1986-eauthor.10aDevelopment of a novel carbon fixation pathway enabled by protein engineering /cAmanda Lee Smith. 1a[Seattle] :b[University of Washington Libraries],c[2015] 4c©2015  a1 online resource (xii, 148 pages) :billustrations (chiefly color)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext filebPDF2rda  bPh.

As a demonstration of this utility, a novel one-carbon assimilation pathway, the Formolase pathway, was implemented in Escherichia coli using a computationally designed enzyme. This pathway was designed to address a need for more sustainable feedstocks for biochemical production. With the documented ability to produce formate from carbon dioxide, this efficient, linear pathway allows for carbon sequestration and utilization through transformation to chemicals or fuels in industrial hosts that do not naturally fix carbon. The development of formolase, a carboligase, through computational protein design enables this pathway by joining 3-1C molecules into 1-3C molecule that accesses glycolysis via phosphorylation. This glycolytic flux can become any number of biochemical products using well-characterized production pathways. In this work, in vitro function of the formolase pathway is presented and efforts to improve pathway function are detailed.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed December 16, 2015). 0aBacterial proteinsxDesign. 0aEscherichia colixBiotechnology. 0aFormic acidxSynthesis. 0aCarbon dioxidexMetabolism. 7aCarbon dioxidexMetabolism.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00846823 7aEscherichia colixBiotechnology.2fast0(OCoLC)fst017670060 aCarbon fixation0 aMetabolic engineering 4aThesesxChemical engineering 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aLidstrom, Mary E.,edegree supervisor.40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/33639  aWAUW05191cam a2200493Ii 4500001001000000008004100010006001900051005001700070007001400087040007000101100003400171245017500205264006300380264001100443300007200454336002600526337002600552338003600578347002400614502004300638504005700681520322600738588009803964650002804062650001304090650003204103650002704135650003904162650005804201650005404259650005304313653003004366653002604396653002404422653002904446653001604475653000804491655003304499655004704532655002804579700004404607856003704651049000904688932359124151216t20152015waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20190625172436.7cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdacWAUdOCLCAdOCLCQdOCLCOdWAUdOCLCFdOCLCQdOCLCO1 aRichardson, Beau J.,eauthor.10aStudies of pyrite FeS₂ nanocrystals and plasmonic nanostructures for low cost and high efficiency inverted bulk heterojunction photovoltaic cells /cBeau J.

Organic photovoltaics (OPVs) offer great potential for lower fabrication and materials costs as they are solution processable, compatible with high throughput roll-to-roll printing processes, flexible, lightweight and have tunable material properties. The encompassing goal of this work is to explore new materials, nanostructures and device designs that may aid the development of OPVs towards large scale, low cost and more efficient PV technologies. In the search for new PV materials, pyrite iron disulfide (FeS₂) is noticeable as an earth abundant and environmentally benign semiconductor with low procurement costs and advantageous optoelectronic properties. Here, pyrite FeS₂ nanocrystals (NCs) were synthesized and deployed in ternary organic-inorganic hybrid bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells with an inverted architecture. Three device performance regimes are observed when the pyrite NC concentration is varied from 0 to 4 wt% that appear linked to microstructure transitions in the active layer. The addition of FeS₂ NCs consistently increased photocurrent and exposure in air actually rectified current leakage resulting in an average 28% increase in power conversion efficiency (PCE) of hybrid devices compared to control devices. The photocurrent enhancement and air-stability demonstrated by this inverted design offer a promising architecture for future pyrite FeS₂ NC-based devices. Furthermore, the NC characterizations presented here provide insight to advance pyrite's development as a PV material. Nanostructures of various types can be used to enhance OPV performance. The effects of nanostructured ZnO electron transport layers (ETLs) were studied in high efficiency inverted OPVs on ITO substrates. Nano-ridged and planar ZnO ETLs were formed and consistently high FFs exceeding 70% and PCEs reaching 8.32% were achieved on both types of nanostructures when maintaining optimal active layer thickness. ITO is the most common transparent electrode used in OPVs, yet limited indium reserves and poor mechanical properties of ITO on flexible substrates make it non-ideal for large-scale OPV production. To replace ITO, plasmonic nanostructured electrodes were designed, fabricated and deployed as electrodes in inverted OPV devices. ZnO thickness was found to significantly impact active layer absorption due to resonant cavity effects with the plasmonic nanostructured electrodes. Devices with thinner ZnO ETLs showed PCEs as high as 5.70% and higher JSC's than devices on thicker ZnO. ITO-free, flexible devices on PET showed a PCE of 1.82% and those fabricated on ultrathin and conformable Parylene substrates yielded an initial PCE over 1%. To our knowledge, this is the first time nanopatterned plasmonic electrodes have been applied to highly flexible, ITO-free OPVs. With further fabrication development to improve nanopattern quality on flexible substrates, these designs show promise for highly functioning conformable devices that can be applied to numerous needs for lightweight, ubiquitous power generation.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed December 16, 2015). 0aSolar cellsxMaterials. 0aPyrites. 0aSemiconductor nanocrystals. 0aZinc oxide thin films. 7aPyrites.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01084661 7aSemiconductor nanocrystals.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01112176 7aSolar cellsxMaterials.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01124941 7aZinc oxide thin films.2fast0(OCoLC)fst011844400 aNanostructured Electrodes0 aOrganic Photovoltaics0 aOrganic Solar Cells0 aPlasmonic Nanostructures0 aPyrite FeS20 aZnO 4aThesesxChemical engineering 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aYu, Qiuming,d1963-edegree supervisor.40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/33641  aWAUW
