Nickel oxide (NiO[subscript]x) offers promising characteristics for a winning hole transport layer (HTL), such as high optical transmittance, high stability, easy processability, and a wide band gap that allows high hole mobility and good electron blocking ability. In this work, NiOx was synthesized by first forming Ni(OH)₂ in the precipitation reaction of (Ni(NO₃)₂· 6H₂O) and NaOH. The synthesized NiO[subscript]x nanocrystals was dissolved in DI water to different concentrations and used as a HTL in the inverted p-i-n CsSnI₃ PVSCs. The effects of annealing condition, concentration of NiO[subscript]x ink and spin speed on the NiOx film morphology and surface roughness were explored. In addition, CsSnI₃ thin films were fabricated to be the active layer and solar cells with the inverted structure were fabricated and tested.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed September 21, 2020). 0aPerovskite solar cells. 0aNickel oxide. 7aPerovskite solar cells.2fast0(OCoLC)fst02009247 7aNickel oxide.2fast0(OCoLC)fst018947720 aChemical engineering 4aThesesxChemical engineering. 7aAcademic theses2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aYu, Qiuming,d1963-edegree supervisor.40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/45886  aWAUW03505cam a2200505 i 45000010011000000080041000110060019000520050017000710070014000880400051001021000027001532450115001802640063002952640011003583000070003693360026004393370026004653380036004913470021005273470008005485020049005565040055006055201586006605880099022466500048023456500021023936500025024146500012024396500038024516500051024896500047025406500074025876530021026616530026026826530018027086530027027266530023027536530025027766550034028016550046028356550028028817000044029098560037029530490009029901195708110200914t20202020waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20210120172538.2cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdWAUdOCLCFdOCLdOCLCO1 aBoese, Julia,eauthor.10aExploiting the interactions of solid binding proteins with silica to form colloidal assemblies /cJulia Boese. 1a[Seattle] :b[University of Washington Libraries],c[2020] 4c©2020  a1 online resource (ix, 57 pages) :billustrations (chiefly color)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext file2rdaft  bPDF  bM.S.

When genetically encoded within proteins, SBPs can function as linkers to create hybrid materials comprising inorganic components and the proteins to which they are fused. Here, we show how such solid binding proteins may be employed to achieve dynamic control over the assembly and disassembly of silica nanoparticles and how the process is influenced by SBP sequence, insertion point within the protein, and solution conditions. Using fluorescent-resonant energy transfer (FRET), dynamic light scattering (DLS) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), we show that bifunctional derivatives of superfolder green fluorescent protein (sfGFP) engineered with two strong, or with a strong and a weak silica-binding peptide support the pH-dependent aggregation and disaggregation of rhodamine-containing silica nanoparticle (RhSiNP). We further demonstrate that pH shifts can be used to cycle nanoparticles between assembled and dispersed states and that aggregate size can be tuned with different SBPs, NP sizes, and salt concentrations. Additionally, we designed multimeric de novo and natural proteins for increased control over the pattering of silica nanoparticles (SiNPs) and designed ZnS binding and cysteine binding sfGFP for the association of QDs into protein-linked nanomaterials. This new paradigm for the synthesis of dynamic nanoparticle systems should find applications in biosensing, diagnostics, and advanced materials.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed September 14, 2020). 0aPeptidesxStructure-activity relationships. 0aProtein binding. 0aProtein engineering. 0aSilica. 7aSilica.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01118585 7aProtein engineering.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01079685 7aProtein binding.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01079673 7aPeptidesxStructure-activity relationships.2fast0(OCoLC)fst010575790 aHybrid materials0 aNanomaterial assembly0 aNanoparticles0 aSolid Binding peptides0 aStimuli dependence0 aChemical engineering 4aThesesxChemical engineering. 7aAcademic theses2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aBaneyx, François,edegree supervisor.40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/45876  aWAUW02955cam a2200505 i 45000010011000000080041000110060019000520050017000710070014000880400051001021000036001532450078001892640063002672640011003303000060003413360026004013370026004273380036004533470021004893470008005105020042005185040055005605201144006155880099017596500029018586500014018876500018019016500017019196500043019366500040019796500044020196530033020636530024020966530027021206530036021476530019021836530025022026530025022276550034022526550046022866550028023327000040023608560040024000490009024401196340746200921t20202020waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20210120172829.0cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdOCLCFdWAUdOCLdOCLCO1 aBonageri, Shrilakshmi,eauthor.10aData classification in high throughput screening /cShrilakshmi Bonageri. 1a[Seattle] :b[University of Washington Libraries],c[2020] 4c©2020  a1 online resource (ix, 79 pages) :bcolor illustrations  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext file2rdaft  bPDF  bM.S.cUniversity of Washingtond2020.  aIncludes bibliographical references (pages 76-79).3 aRedox flow batteries offer an economical, low vulnerability means to store electrical energy at grid scale. Most commercial flow batteries use concentrated sulphuric acid with vanadium as the active redox material. While they have many inherent benefits, the use of vanadium drives up their cost. Deep eutectic solvents (DESs) are promising electrolyte solvents for less expensive and more sustainable organic redox species due to their biodegradability, low cost, high solvent quality and molecular versatility. High throughput screening (HTS) was used to synthesize and measure thermal and electrochemical properties of DESs to rapidly find an optimum DES for use in redox flow batteries. As a vast amount of data with varying characteristics based on the samples being tested is produced, data classification is essential to automate data analysis. Thus, convolutional neural networks and long short term memory networks were successfully used to classify HTS data into predefined categories and eliminate noisy data. Suitable data analysis techniques were then developed for each category of classified data to obtain accurate results.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed September 21, 2020). 0aFlow batteriesxTesting. 0aSolvents. 0aElectrolytes. 0aVoltammetry. 7aVoltammetry.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01168951 7aSolvents.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01125677 7aElectrolytes.2fast0(OCoLC)fst009064890 aConvolutional neural network0 aData classification0 aDeep eutectic solvents0 aHigh throughput experimentation0 aNeural network0 aRedox flow batteries0 aChemical engineering 4aThesesxChemical engineering. 7aAcademic theses2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aPozzo, Lilo D.,edegree supervisor.4070uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/45888  aWAUW02676cam a2200469 i 45000010011000000080041000110060019000520050017000710070014000880400051001020660007001531000034001602450070001942640063002642640011003273000067003383360026004053370026004313380036004573470021004933470008005145020049005225040055005715880087006266500026007136500032007396500044007716500058008156500052008736530016009256530018009416530021009596530022009806530025010026550034010276550046010616550028011077000058011358560037011938800967012300490009021971196340223200921t20202020waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20210120172747.7cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdOCLCFdWAUdOCLdOCLCO  c(S1 aChen, Guoyao,d1995-eauthor.12aA high-resolution 3D printable porous biomaterial /cGuoyao Chen. 1a[Seattle] :b[University of Washington Libraries],c[2020] 4c©2020  a1 online resource (vi, 40 pages) :billustrations (some color)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext file2rdaft  bPDF  bM.S.

A porous biomaterial with 40μm pore size has been found to have good performance in reducing the foreign body reaction upon implantation, and since the inner structure is regular, a stereolithography 3D printing system was tried to print this high-resolution structure. This work has demonstrated with the laser intensity at 1Ã 10-6% and the writing speed at 1mm/s, the top surface of this structure can be printed with the commercially available resin DS2000, but the side faces cannot be properly printed due to the photo sensitiveness of the resin. The top surface of a complex and large shape, an insulin pump catheter, was also printed well. A few 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) based formulas have also been tried in the printer, though further optimization is needed to accurately print high resolution structures with HEMA.  aWAUW03470cam a2200541 i 45000010011000000080041000110060019000520050017000710070014000880400051001021000035001532450141001882640063003292640011003923000067004033360026004703370026004963380036005223470021005583470008005795020042005875040057006295201496006865880099021826500016022816500035022976500024023326500032023566500042023886500061024306500058024916500050025496530007025996530013026066530011026196530007026306530007026376530018026446530022026626530011026846530025026956550034027206550046027546550028028007000051028288560040028790490009029191196339840200921t20202020waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20210120172953.3cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdOCLCFdWAUdOCLdOCLCO1 aChin, Jeffrey,d1988-eauthor.10aDouble cation substitution of CZTSSe constituents to reduce detrimental defects clusters and improve device performance /cJeffrey Chin. 1a[Seattle] :b[University of Washington Libraries],c[2020] 4c©2020  a1 online resource (30 unnumbered pages) :bcolor illustrations  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext file2rdaft  bPDF  bM.S.cUniversity of Washingtond2020.  aIncludes bibliographical references (pages [29-30]).3 aSolution processed thin-film photovoltaic (PV) technology is poised to be the future of manufacturing standard for commercially available solar energy modules due to the substantially low estimated capital expenditure (CAPEX) required. Over the decades, the concept of high efficiency CZTSSe has enticed researchers but always eluded their grasps. This report explores improving the device performance metrics of CZTSSe with the goal of improving the PCE in hopes that it become industrially disruptive to the currently adopted technologies. The approach taken in this research was to conduct double cation alloying with elements shown in literature to have beneficial impacts for CZTSSe device performance with the hypothesis that the combination would be complementary. First, we investigated the combination of small stoichiometric substitutions of Cu with Ag and Zn with Mn so that the resulting stoichiometry would resemble (Agx,Cu1-[subscript]x)2(Mn[subscript]yZn[subscript]1-y)Sn(S,Se)₄. Second we investigated the double cation substitution of Cu with Ag and Sn with Ge so that the already proven effects of Ge incorporation could be correlated with the effects of Ag. Collectively, the work included in this report demonstrates considerable progress exploring uncharted avenues toward increasing the performance of CZTSSe. By attempting a new approach to understanding optoelectronic performance and reliability in CZTSSe the goal of high efficiency CZTSSe may soon be attainable.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed September 21, 2020). 0aThin films. 0aPhotovoltaic power generation. 0aCopper-zinc alloys. 0aMetal oxide semiconductors. 7aThin films.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01150018 7aPhotovoltaic power generation.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01062167 7aMetal oxide semiconductors.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01017624 7aCopper-zinc alloys.2fast0(OCoLC)fst008785740 aAg0 aAlloying0 aCZTSSe0 aGe0 aMn0 aVoc deffiecit0 aMaterials Science0 aEnergy0 aChemical engineering 4aThesesxChemical engineering. 7aAcademic theses2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aHillhouse, Hugh W.,d1972-edegree supervisor.4070uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/45879  aWAUW03525cam a2200445 i 45000010011000000080041000110060019000520050017000710070014000880400051001021000028001532450084001812640063002652640011003283000066003393360026004053370026004313380036004573470021004933470008005145020049005225040055005715201883006265880099025096500015026086500013026236500015026366500027026516500039026786500041027176500053027586500041028116530025028526550034028776550046029116550028029577000048029858560037030330490009030701195712907200914t20202020waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20210120172459.1cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdWAUdOCLCFdOCLdOCLCO1 aGu, Ge,d1996-eauthor.10aSupercritical fluid-liquid-solid growth of alloyed Si1-xGex nanowires /cGe Gu. 1a[Seattle] :b[University of Washington Libraries],c[2020] 4c©2020  a1 online resource (v, 30 pages) :billustrations (some color)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext file2rdaft  bPDF  bM.S.

However, one significant challenge of their practical implementation is the large volume change associated with the insertion and extraction of lithium ions, which results in mechanical pulverization and capacity fade. Nanostructuring active material morphology has been demonstrated as a strategy to compensate for volume change and improve capacity and cycle life in lithium ion batteries. Although Si has the highest theoretical capacity among elemental lithium ion battery negative electrodes and maintains distinct advantages as an electrode material, silicon's rate capability is hindered by its lower ionic diffusivity and electronic conductivity in comparison to Ge. However, Ge is much more expensive, which could limit its widespread use in anodes for lithium ion batteries. In an effort to capitalize on the benefits of both materials, there has been recent interest in developing an anode that combines the excellent rate capability of Ge with the high capacity and lower cost of Si. Recent efforts have demonstrated the ability to synthesize alloyed Si1-xGex nanowires (NWs) via a solution-based mechanism, using a thin film of tin to seed nanowire growth. In order to improve the scalability of this process, here we report the supercritical fluid-based synthesis of Sn nanocrystal-seeded alloyed Si1-xGex NWs. By balancing reaction parameters such as precursor reactivity, the semiconductor precursor to metal seed ratio, Si:Ge precursor ratio, and reaction temperature, we demonstrate the ability to synthesize alloyed Si1-xGex NWs through a colloidal, supercritical fluid-based process for the first time.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed September 14, 2020). 0aNanowires. 0aSilicon. 0aGermanium. 0aLithium ion batteries. 7aSilicon.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01118631 7aNanowires.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01032641 7aLithium ion batteries.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01764640 7aGermanium.2fast0(OCoLC)fst009420780 aChemical engineering 4aThesesxChemical engineering. 7aAcademic theses2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aHolmberg, Vincent Carl,edegree supervisor.40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/45877  aWAUW04694cam a2200397 i 45000010011000000080041000110060019000520050017000710070014000880400051001020660007001531000035001602450110001952640063003052640011003683000068003793360026004473370026004733380036004993470021005353470008005565020049005645040055006135880099006686500057007676500037008246500063008616530025009246550034009496550046009836550028010297000048010578560037011058803145011420490009042871196340715200921t20202020waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20210115175134.5cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdOCLCFdWAUdOCLdOCLCO  c(S1 aHsu, Chih-Wei,d1995-eauthor.10aData science approaches for tracking electrochemical reactions and phase transformations /cChih-Wei Hsu. 1a[Seattle] :b[University of Washington Libraries],c[2020] 4c©2020  a1 online resource (vii, 42 pages) :billustrations (some color)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext file2rdaft  bPDF  bM.S.

However, fully utilizing the data obtained via battery characterization, particularly battery cycling can be difficult, because so many data points are produced during battery cycling. A more recent innovation in battery characterization is to leverage data science to more fully utilize information obtained during various battery cycling protocols. Herein, we introduce two examples of using data science approaches combined with the battery characterization to maximize the value of the characterization data: total differential capacity (dQ/dV) plots and galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT). Total differential capacity plots are a powerful tool for understanding battery degradation when combined with various characterization techniques. However, due to the large amount of data, it is difficult to obtain quantitative conclusions via visual analysis, the typical approach for total differential capacity analysis. As a result, a data science approach was proposed to support quantitative conclusions for total differential capacity analysis. Herein, a software package has been developed to quantitatively analyze the battery cycling data from the dQ/dV plots. In addition, a user interface was built up and some documentations and demonstrations were set up to help the users have a better understanding of the codes and make it more accessible to use. Besides the application in tracking the electrochemical reactions within the battery, data science can also be combined with GITT to extract thermodynamic and kinetic data from a battery. This work focuses on generalizing a previously developed novel GITT model that accurately determined the lithium ion diffusions coefficient for a two-phase lithium iron phosphate electrode, so that the model can readily be applied to any phase transformation battery electrode (LiFePO₄) system. We validate our generalized tool both by replicating the data from the previous work and using the generalized tool to determine the sodium ions diffusion coefficients in the two-phase region during the sodium antimonide (Na₃Sb) battery charge-discharge cycling. In the standard GITT diffusivity model, the diffusion coefficients can appear to be many of magnitude lower in the two-phase region. This apparent drop occurs because phase transformation is not considered in the GITT diffusivity model. Therefore, the novel phase transformation GITT diffusivity model that we develop into a tool in this work takes both the diffusion and the interface migration into account. By solving the 1-D diffusion partial differential equations (PDEs) with the corresponding moving boundary conditions, the concentration profile, and the diffusion coefficients in both α and β phase can be determined. The diffusion coefficients obtained by the new model in the two-phase region are about 10⁻¹⁵~ 10⁻¹⁴ cm²/s for α and β phase, which is validated by the similarity of the diffusion coefficients calculated by the standard model in the single-phase region.  aWAUW04262cam a2200553 i 45000010011000000080041000110060019000520050017000710070014000880400058001021000025001602450111001852640063002962640011003593000093003703360026004633370026004893380036005153470021005513470008005725020044005805040057006245202183006815880094028646500041029586500019029996500018030186500021030366500068030576500047031256500067031726500045032396500044032846530018033286530012033466530019033586530018033776530022033956530025034176530025034426530018034676530019034856550034035046550047035386550028035857000049036138560037036620490009036991244817602210405t20202020waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20210714142827.9cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdOCLCOdOCLCFdWAUdOCLCOdOCL1 aLiao, Rick,eauthor.10aAntioxidant-loaded nanoparticles for the treatment of excitotoxicity in neurological disease /cRick Liao. 1a[Seattle] :b[University of Washington Libraries],c[2020] 4c©2020  a1 online resource (2 unnumbered pages, viii, 117 pages) :billustrations (chiefly color)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext file2rdaft  bPDF  bPh.

In acute neurological injury, a process known as excitotoxicity manifests from energy failure or direct trauma, causing overexcitation of neurons that leads to neuronal toxicity. Following neuronal death, toxic metabolites and cellular debris accumulate in the brain, perpetuating excitotoxicity to neighboring neurons. Despite the heavy social and economic toll and extensive research into neurotherapeutic development, there are currently no approved therapeutics for targeting excitotoxicity after acute neurological injury. The difficulty in clinical translation is largely attributed to several barriers intrinsic to the brain, including traversing the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and diffusion through the brain parenchyma. Therefore, in addition to understanding the biological complexity of the brain, developing effective therapeutics is a drug delivery problem. To expedite the pre-clinical research process, we have developed a tailorable organotypic whole hemisphere (OWH) brain slice model, capable of mimicking in vivo processes including excitotoxity and neuroinflammation. Using OWH models, we can systematically study disease processes and screen therapeutics in a high-throughput fashion, bypassing delivery obstacles. To improve therapeutic enzyme delivery, we have developed brain-penetrating antioxidant enzyme-loaded polymeric nanoparticles that inhibit enzymatic degradation. Furthermore, via nanoparticle screening on the OWH model, we have elucidated the toxicity of a common polymeric nanoparticle formulation involving poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) and sonication, and developed alternative biocompatible nanoparticle formulations. Finally, the OWH model has enabled detailed observation of disease-dependent nanoparticle-microglia interactions that can better inform drug delivery strategies. Throughout these studies, we have implemented a transdisciplinary approach that emphasizes thorough understanding of the neurobiology of disease and leverages chemical engineering fundamentals, to ultimately advance neurotherapeutic development.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed April 5, 2021). 0aNervous systemxDiseasesxTreatment. 0aNanoparticles. 0aAntioxidants. 0aNeurotoxicology.12aNervous System Diseasesxphysiopathology.0(DNLM)D009422Q000503 7aNeurotoxicology.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01036560 7aNervous systemxDiseasesxTreatment.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01036124 7aNanoparticles.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01032624 7aAntioxidants.2fast0(OCoLC)fst008106420 aDrug delivery0 aEnzymes0 aExcitotoxicity0 aNanoparticles0 aNeuroinflammation0 aNeurological disease0 aChemical engineering0 aNeurosciences0 aNanotechnology 4aThesesxChemical engineering. 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aNance, Elizabeth,d1985-edegree supervisor.40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/46396  aWAUW02132cam a2200409 i 45000010011000000080041000110060019000520050017000710070014000880400051001021000033001532450090001862640063002762640011003393000060003503360026004103370026004363380036004623470021004983470008005195020042005275040055005695200577006245880099012016500020013006500023013206500042013436500068013856500046014536530025014996550034015246550046015586550028016047000041016328560040016730490009017131196339786200921t20202020waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20210120172332.0cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdOCLCFdWAUdOCLdOCLCO1 aLiu, Kailei,d1994-eauthor.10aProtein-bound uremic toxin kinetics modeling for a new dialysis device /cKailei Liu. 1a[Seattle] :b[University of Washington Libraries],c[2020] 4c©2020  a1 online resource (iv, 21 pages) :bcolor illustrations  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext file2rdaft  bPDF  bM.S.cUniversity of Washingtond2020.  aIncludes bibliographical references (pages 19-21).3 aAddition to the conventional hemodialysis, a protein-bound uremic toxins process device is designed.

The electronic, optical, and mechanical properties of semiconductor nanowires can be considerably different than their bulk counterparts, making them attractive for a range of applications including sensors, energy storage, and quantum information systems. Solution-based synthesis is a promising strategy to produce semiconductor nanowires in a scalable, cost-effective matter. However, many solution-based methods are limited in their ability to produce nanowires with increasingly complex compositions-including doped, alloyed, and heterostructured architectures-as well as to rapidly screen synthetic parameters for combinatorial discovery and optimization. In addition, chemistries and growth dynamics can be difficult to track with nanowire syntheses that require high temperature and extreme pressure equipment. Moreover, the widespread integration of semiconductor nanowires into devices will also require new methods of assembly as well as careful consideration of surface chemistry. After an introduction to current methods of semiconductor nanowire synthesis, existing tactics for nanowire assembly, and strategies to improve the energy density of lithium ion batteries with group IV nanomaterials, this dissertation will cover three main topics related to (i) new synthetic methods for nanowire growth, (ii) a novel light-based nanowire assembly process, and (iii) the integration of nanowires into high-energy-density composite electrodes for lithium ion batteries. Herein, we demonstrate a new continuous-flow, laser-driven, nanowire growth process that exploits the light absorption of colloidal metal nanocrystals to drive semiconductor nanowire growth in an optically accessible reactor on the benchtop, potentially opening the door for both rapid screening of synthetic parameters as well as in situ studies of nanowire growth dynamics. Investigations of solution-based nanowire growth using this system establish that laser-driven syntheses can achieve rapid, on-demand growth of semiconductor nanowires. Importantly, the integration of nanowires into future device architectures will require a wide range of assembly strategies. While current solution-based nanowire assembly processes struggle to create deterministic heterojunctions, here, we demonstrate a novel example of nanowire assembly in a high-Prandtl-number organic solvent system, using an optical trap to orient, align, and "solder" metal-seeded semiconductor nanowires into periodic axial heterostructures. Finally, we investigate the role of surface functionalization on the integration of group-IV nanowires into high-capacity alloying electrodes for lithium ion batteries. We demonstrate that interfacial chemistry affects electrochemical access to different phases of lithiated germanium, and by carefully controlling the nanowire surface chemistry, we eliminate the need for the fluorinated electrolyte additives typically required for the stable cycling of group-IV-based, lithium-ion battery electrodes. In addition, we demonstrate that by balancing precursor decomposition kinetics, alloyed silicon-germanium (SiGe) nanowires can be synthesized through supercritical-fluid-based processes, potentially improving the rate capability of high-capacity silicon-based electrode materials produced via scalable processes. We anticipate that the information gained from these solution-based synthetic methods, assembly techniques, and surface chemistry studies will inform synthetic compositional control, elucidate relationships between solution-based reaction parameters and emergent properties, and advance the integration of solution-grown semiconductor nanowires into next-generation devices.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed May 18, 2020). 0aNanowires. 0aSemiconductors. 0aSilicon. 0aGermanium. 7aSilicon.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01118631 7aSemiconductors.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01112198 7aNanowires.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01032641 7aGermanium.2fast0(OCoLC)fst009420780 aAssembly0 aBatteries0 aNanowires0 aSemiconductor0 aSynthesis0 aChemical engineering0 aNanoscience 4aThesesxChemical engineering. 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aHolmberg, Vincent Carl,edegree supervisor.40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/45457  aWAUW03082cam a2200505 i 45000010011000000060019000110080041000300050017000710070014000880400046001021000038001482450143001862640063003292640011003923000089004033360026004923370026005183380036005443470021005803470008006015020049006095040055006585201165007135880094018786500028019726500014020006500024020146500040020386500050020786500054021286530027021826530025022096530024022346530035022586530017022936530026023106530016023366530025023526550034023776550047024116550028024587000044024868560037025300490009025671244554965m     o  d s      210402t20202020waua    obm  s000 0 eng d20210506221600.9cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdWAUdOCLCOdOCLCF1 aRamakrishnan, Shripathi,eauthor.10aHighly efficient all-polymer solar cells based on wide bandgap donor copolymers containing selenophene moieties /cShripathi Ramakrishnan. 1a[Seattle] :b[University of Washington Libraries],c[2020] 4c©2020  a1 online resource (2 unnumbered pages, v, 73 pages) :billustrations (chiefly color)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext file2rdaft  bPDF  bM.S.

Compared to PBDB-S, PBDBS-T displayed a narrower bandgap and red-shifted absorption owing to an upshifted HOMO by 0.13 eV. Both donors displayed significantly enhanced hole mobilities compared to PBDB-T, resulting in significantly higher photocurrent values of 17.51 mA/cm2 and 18.31 mA/cm2. Additionally, the superior crystallinity, and phase-separated morphology conferred by PBDBS-T resulted in efficient exciton dissociation and charge transport, enabling greater fill factors up to 63.5% and 9.5% efficiency. These results indicate that a selenophene p-spacer in a D-A polymeric backbone is beneficial to the photovoltaic properties, photophysics, and morphology of all-PSCs and is a promising molecular design strategy to develop highly efficient all-PSCs.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed April 2, 2021). 0aSolar cellsxMaterials. 0aPolymers. 0aSelenium compounds. 7aPolymers.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01070588 7aSelenium compounds.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01111416 7aSolar cellsxMaterials.2fast0(OCoLC)fst011249410 aAll-Polymer Solar Cell0 aCrystallinity tuning0 aDevice optimization0 aDonor polymer molecular design0 aPhotophysics0 aSelenophene pi-spacer0 aEngineering0 aChemical engineering 4aThesesxChemical engineering. 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aJenekhe, Samson A.,edegree supervisor.40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/46393  aWAUW03581cam a2200469 i 45000010011000000080041000110060019000520050017000710070014000880400044001021000036001462450105001822640063002872640011003503000068003613360026004293370026004553380036004813470021005173470008005385000010005465020044005565040041006005201846006415880093024876500026025806500026026066500025026326500027026576500052026846500053027366500052027896530025028416530022028666530025028886550034029136550047029476550028029947000043030228560037030650490009031021154646404200518t20202020waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20200716184204.8cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdWAUdOCLCFdOCL1 aRuskowitz, Emily Rose,eauthor.10aPhotochemical and logic-based regulation over the cellular microenvironment /cEmily Rose Ruskowitz. 1a[Seattle] :b[University of Washington Libraries],c[2020] 4c©2020  a1 online resource (vi, 150 pages) :billustrations (some color)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext file2rdaft  bPDF  aVita.  bPh.

By better understanding how well-defined combinations of individual biochemical signals including proteins presented in this space operate in (a)synchrony to direct cellular and integrated tissue function, we can begin to unravel irregularities within diseased systems and utilize this information to engineer therapies that promote healthy recovery. As photochemical reactions can be uniquely modulated in time and space, this dissertation develops and subsequently exploits novel light-based strategies to spatiotemporally control biochemical microenvironments and cellular signaling. First, we establish the cytocompatibility of near-ultraviolet light treatments common to photochemical manipulation through mammalian cell survival assays and global proteomic analyses. Expanding on existing concepts of photoresponsive drug delivery, we then introduce a generalizable strategy to govern biochemical signal presentation within biomaterials in response to precise combinations of environmental factors following user-programmable Boolean logic. Finally, we introduce the first genetically encoded protein-protein photoligation chemistry, and demonstrate its utility in irreversibly directing protein binding, function, and interactions both intra- and extracellularly. Employing this versatile photoreaction, we demonstrate 3D patterned immobilization of full-length proteins within biomaterials and user-guided intracellular protein activity. Such newly afforded 4D control over biological systems is expected to further basic biological understanding and advance medicine through enhanced tissue engineering and therapeutic delivery approaches.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed May 18, 2020). 0aBiomedical materials. 0aPhotonicsxMaterials. 0aPolymersxMaterials. 0aDrug delivery systems. 7aPhotonicsxMaterials.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01062075 7aDrug delivery systems.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00898667 7aBiomedical materials.2fast0(OCoLC)fst008325860 aBiomedical Materials0 aProtein Chemistry0 aChemical engineering 4aThesesxChemical engineering. 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aDeForest, Cole A.,edegree supervisor.40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/45455  aWAUW03429cam a2200445 i 45000010011000000080041000110060019000520050017000710070014000880400053001021000040001552450105001952640063003002640011003633000076003743360026004503370026004763380036005023470021005383470008005595020049005675040055006165201810006715880093024816500044025746500022026186530021026406530031026616530017026926530021027096530015027306530009027456530025027546550034027796550047028136550028028607000049028888560037029370490009029741244817250210405t20202020waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20210716171246.7cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdOCLCOdOCLCFdWAUdOCLCO1 aShackelford, David,d1992-eauthor.10aComparing machine learning classification methods for biological tracking data /cDavid Shackelford. 1a[Seattle] :b[University of Washington Libraries],c[2020] 4c©2020  a1 online resource (3 unnumbered pages, 49 pages) :bcolor illustrations  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext file2rdaft  bPDF  bM.S.

The additional use of machine learning (ML) methods has previously been proven successful in classifying both single particle tracking and MPT data for many biological systems. In order to further utilize collected MPT data for studies focused on nanoparticle diffusion within biological environments, a new predictive package, referred to as diff_predictor was developed in this study. This package uses feature and trajectory datasets, along with prediction methods such as XGBoost, recurrent neural networks, and random forest decision trees, to make predictions and classifications about the biological environment and nanoparticle behavior. To apply diff_predictor, I took a threefold approach: First, an extreme gradient boosting decision tree (XGBoost) was applied to a study of diffusion in a developing region within the brain to predict age based on spatial features. The features used in classification were analyzed for importance using Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) values. Second, a long short-term memory recurrent neural network algorithm was used on the temporal data from the same dataset and the results were compared with XGBoost and random forest models. Finally, demonstration of the versatility of the diff_predictor package showed we can classify regional differences in diffusion in the brain using a new different experimental dataset. The models produced by diff_predictor had accuracies up to 54.56% for prediction in age-based data, and accuracies up to 91.35% for prediction in regional-based data. Furthermore, SHAP values produced by the decision tree methods in diff_predictor provided useful information toward nanoparticle environment and interactions.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewedApril 5, 2021). 0aParticle dynamicsxMathematical models. 0aMachine learning.0 aMachine learning0 aMultiple Particle Tracking0 aNanoparticle0 aNanotherapeutics0 aPrediction0 aSHAP0 aChemical engineering 4aThesesxChemical engineering. 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aNance, Elizabeth,d1985-edegree supervisor.40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/46394  aWAUW05213cam a2200517 i 45000010011000000080041000110060019000520050017000710070014000880400044001021000032001462450153001782640063003312640011003943000072004053360026004773370026005033380036005293470021005653470008005865000010005945020044006045040057006485203269007055880093039746500028040676500023040956500023041186500022041416500049041636500049042126500054042616500048043156530025043636530021043886530029044096530014044386530018044526530019044706550034044896550047045236550028045707000051045988560037046490490009046861154647967200518t20202020waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20200716184306.1cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdWAUdOCLCFdOCL1 aStoddard, Ryan J.,eauthor.10aDevelopment of stable, high optoelectronic quality perovskites using photoluminescence, photoconductivity, and machine learning /cRyan J.

Reducing the cost of photovoltaics can be attained by improving power conversion efficiency, increasing module lifetime, and reducing processing and CAPEX costs. However, mature technologies such as silicon are presently approaching fundamental efficiency limits, and cost reductions have plateaued. Hybrid Perovskites (HPs) are an emerging material class that show promise since they are inexpensive to fabricate via solution processing, and they have broadly tunable material properties. The HP bandgap can be precisely tuned to pair with silicon in a tandem solar cell, increasing the theoretical power conversion efficiency limit with minimal additional processing costs. The work presented in this dissertation is broadly focused on improving the performance and reliability of perovskite materials for photovoltaic applications. First, I demonstrate a photoluminescence-photoconductivity (PL-PC) technique that directly measures HP quasi-Fermi level splitting ([Delta]E[subscript]F) and carrier diffusion length (L[subscript]D), which are predictors of device open-circuit voltage and short-circuit current respectively. I use this PC-PL technique to highlight several cases where [Delta]E[subscript]F and L[subscript]D are anti-correlated and show the importance of quantifying L[subscript]D in determining overall absorber optoelectronic quality. Next, I focus on development of high-bandgap HPs for tandem applications. Although halide mixing can increase the bandgap to make an ideal bandgap pairing with silicon in tandem applications, the mixed-halide HPs suffer from lower relative voltages and phase instabilities under illumination. Using high-throughput combinatorial exploration, I identified a new compositional motif using larger guanidinium and smaller cesium to form a stable HP structure with enhanced lattice strain. This class of mixed-halide HPs with enhanced strain show modified band structure, higher film [Delta]E[subscript]F, and device open-circuit voltage. I expanded the combinatorial exploration of HP compositions and collect a dataset of 13,000 photoluminescence (PL) spectra indexed by composition. Additionally, I show a proof of concept of using a machine learning approach to predict material bandgap and optoelectronic quality fraction. I also study the origin and impact of phase segregation in mixed-halide HPs and discover phase segregation occurs due to excess charge carriers, which can be generated either by photoexcitation or by current injection. Finally, I study degradation of HP films and devices in various combinations of light, atmosphere, humidity, and thermal stresses and use a machine learning model to link early time behavior to the time it takes the material or device to degrade. This effort reveals simple optical measurements such as transmittance and dark field microscopy have considerable utility in identifying early signs of HP degradation. Collectively, the work included in this dissertation demonstrates considerable progress toward understanding optoelectronic performance and reliability of a wide class of HP materials, with focus on high-bandgap HPs useful for tandem applications.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed May 18, 2020). 0aPerovskite solar cells. 0aPhotoluminescence. 0aPhotoconductivity. 0aMachine learning. 7aPhotoluminescence.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01062036 7aPhotoconductivity.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01061530 7aPerovskite solar cells.2fast0(OCoLC)fst02009247 7aMachine learning.2fast0(OCoLC)fst010047950 aChemical Engineering0 aMachine Learning0 aOptoelectronic Materials0 aPhotonics0 aPhotovoltaics0 aSemiconductors 4aThesesxChemical engineering. 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aHillhouse, Hugh W.,d1972-edegree supervisor.40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/45458  aWAUW05469cam a2200481 i 45000010011000000080041000110060019000520050017000710070014000880400058001021000035001602450150001952640063003452640011004083000087004193360026005063370026005323380036005583470021005943470008006155020044006235040057006675203657007245880094043816500028044756500016045036500022045196500042045416500054045836500048046376530012046856530011046976530015047086530021047236530025047446530019047696550034047886550047048226550028048697000044048978560037049410490009049781244817711210405t20202020waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20210714142900.2cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdOCLCOdOCLCFdWAUdOCLCOdOCL1 aTosado, Gabriella A.,eauthor.10aDevelopment of highly efficient and stable lead-free perovskite solar cells through composition and interface engineering /cGabriella A.

Hybrid organic-inorganic lead halide perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) have emerged in the past decade as a promising low-cost, low energy intensity, thin film solar cell with lab efficiencies reaching 25.2%. The toxicity of Pb perovskites and performance and stability issues with Sn lead-free alternatives remains a major roadblock to commercialization. In this work, novel perovskite compositions are designed and used to study the transition from Pb to Sn perovskites, cations are tuning to implement stabilizing components for pure Sn perovskites, and Sn perovskites performance and stability issues are tackled. The triple cation methylammonium (MA), formamidinium (FA) and Cs, with double halide composition Csx(MA₀.₁₇FA₀.₈₃)₁-xPb₁-ySny(I₀.₈₃Br₀.₁₇)₃ films with x = 0.05, 0.10, and 0.20 and y = 0, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, and 1.0 was used to create a library of new perovskites and study novel band gap trends near the maximum Schockley Quiesser limit. The simple inverted device structure of indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly (3,4, -ethylenedioxythiphene): polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS)/Perovskite/[6,6]-phenyl-C60-butyric acid methyl ester (PC₆₀BM)/fullerene (C₆₀)/2,9-dimethyl-7,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline (BCP)/Ag eliminated dopant instabilities. Due to a high-quality film morphology and optimal bandgap, 3 3 Cs₀.₀₅(MA₀.₁₇FA₀.₈₃)₀.₉₅Pb₀.₂₅Sn₀.₇₅(I₀.₈₃Br₀.₁₇)₃ (band gap = 1.30 eV), achieved a record maximum efficiency of 11.05% for any 75% Sn composition. Moreover, the 75% Sn PVSCs retained 80% of initial PCE after 30 days storage in inert conditions and 100 hours in ambient conditions. After optimizing antisolvent choice, solvent annealing, and hot casting conditions for pure Sn perovskite films, the novel composition with Cs, FA, and guanidinium (GA), (CsGA)xFA₁₀₀ ₂xSnI₃ was implemented. This cation mixture combines the benefits of a guanidinium cation, such as increased hydrogen bonding and no dipole moment, with Cs to fill point defects and relax the crystal lattice to better integrate a large stabilizing agent, ethylenediammonium diiodide (EDAI₂). The EDAI₂ additive not only yielded pinhole-free cubic phase (CsGA)xFA₁₀₀-₂xSnI₃ perovskite films but also decreased both shallow and deep trap states in the perovskite films. The devices with (CsGA)₁₅FA₇₀SnI₃ and 0-2% EDAI₂ all achieved a maximum PCE higher than 5% with the highest of 5.72% for a fresh device with (CsGA)₁₅FA₇₀SnI₃ and 1% EDAI₂. After storage, the maximum PCE was increased from 5.69% to 6.39% for the (CsGA)₁₅FA₇₀SnI₃ and 1.5% EDAI₂ devices. Finally, to tackle energy loss issues that have plagued pure Sn perovskites (loss = 0.6-0.9 V), the misalignment between the PEDOT:PSS hole transport layer and the Sn perovskite valence band was studied due to the energy misalignment between the hole transport layer and pure Sn perovskite valence band. Cosolvent methods, solvent wash methods, and solvent immersion methods with DMSO, EG, and CH₃OH were implemented to alter the PSS content and work function of the HTL to improve alignment. Utilizing the (CsGA)₁₅FA₇₀SnI₃+1.0% EDAI₂ perovskite film we demonstrated a higher performance of 6.29% and 6.16% with a 5% DMSO cosolvent and methanol solvent wash, respectively. This work is a comprehensive push to improve the performance and stability of non-toxic Sn perovskite devices, bringing this technology one step closer to commercialization.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed April 5, 2021). 0aPerovskite solar cells. 0aTin alloys. 0aCesium compounds. 7aTin alloys.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01151292 7aPerovskite solar cells.2fast0(OCoLC)fst02009247 7aCesium compounds.2fast0(OCoLC)fst017453720 aDopants0 aHybrid0 aPerovskite0 aRenewable energy0 aChemical engineering0 aNanotechnology 4aThesesxChemical engineering. 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aYu, Qiuming,d1963-edegree supervisor.40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/46395  aWAUW04114cam a2200469 i 45000010011000000080041000110060019000520050017000710070014000880400063001021000029001652450092001942640063002862640011003493000071003603360026004313370026004573380036004833470021005193470008005405000010005485020044005585040056006025202353006585880099030116500021031106500026031316500038031576500047031956500052032426530020032946530013033146530025033276530025033526530025033776550034034026550046034366550028034827000088035108560037035980490009036351196339739200921t20202020waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20210721171952.1cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdOCLCFdWAUdOCLdOCLCOdWAUdOCLCO1 aTsao, Caroline,eauthor.10aZwitterionic polymer-based platforms for biotherapeutics and implants /cCaroline Tsao. 1a[Seattle] :b[University of Washington Libraries],c[2020] 4c©2020  a1 online resource (ix, 117 pages) :billustrations (chiefly color)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext file2rdaft  bPDF  aVita.  bPh.

Biotherapeutics offer great advantages of high specificity towards difficult diseases, yet biotherapeutics are often physiochemical unstable and immunogenic; implantable devices with multiple functionalities create effective solutions to medical situations, yet they often suffer from reduced longevity due to the foreign body reaction triggered. Many biomaterials have been developed to tackle these issues. However, few biomaterials have been transferred from benchtop to clinical treatments, and biocompatibility issues of biomaterials have started to draw concerns. Thus, the development of new biomaterials is essential for the realization of contemporary medical treatments. In this dissertation, we discuss the development of zwitterionic polymer-based platforms for peptide therapeutics, non-invasive drug delivery, and implants. We first investigate how zwitterionic polymers would enhance the performance of peptides therapeutics. The native glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) no longer suffers from rapid renal clearance and degradation after the conjugation of a zwitterionic polymer and provides glycemic control in mice for up to 6 days, demonstrating its potential as a diabetes treatment. We next develop a non-invasive pulmonary systemic delivery platform for large protein drugs. The zwitterionic polymers significantly improved the bioavailability of organophosphate hydrolase (OPH) and the prevention of organophosphate poisoning through the non-invasive delivery of the conjugated OPH shows significant potential for protecting our warfighters in threat of nerve agents. In addition, we also design high-strength, pure zwitterionic-elastomeric-networked (ZEN) hydrogels through the mechanisms of swellability and the locking effect. The ZEN hydrogels can be considered highly biocompatible as no fibrotic capsule was formed after one year of implantation, which showed great potential for implantable devices. In these studies, we explore and expand the capacity of using zwitterionic polymers for protein/peptide drug delivery and long-term implantation. The new findings could provide new solutions and advance the field of biotherapeutics development, non-invasive drug delivery system, and implantable devices.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed September 21, 2020). 0aPolyzwitterions. 0aBiomedical materials. 0aDrug delivery devicesxMaterials. 7aPolyzwitterions.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01739529 7aBiomedical materials.2fast0(OCoLC)fst008325860 aBiotherapeutics0 aImplants0 aPoly(carboxybetaine)0 aZwitterionic polymer0 aChemical engineering 4aThesesxChemical engineering. 7aAcademic theses2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aJiang, Shaoyi,d1964-edegree supervisor.1http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q8856592040uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/45883  aWAUW02929cam a2200541 i 45000010011000000080041000110060019000520050017000710070014000880400051001021000033001532450084001862640063002702640011003333000067003443360026004113370026004373380036004633470021004993470008005205020042005285040055005705200968006255880099015936500029016926500026017216500032017476500026017796500030018056500056018356500052018916500052019436500058019956530016020536530017020696530012020866530013020986530012021116530023021236530019021466530025021656550034021906550046022246550028022707000043022988560037023410490009023781196340155200921t20202020waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20210120172533.5cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdOCLCFdWAUdOCLdOCLCO1 aWu, Kun-Lin,d1993-eauthor.10aPharmacological regulation of protein-polymer hydrogel stiffness /cKun-Lin Wu. 1a[Seattle] :b[University of Washington Libraries],c[2020] 4c©2020  a1 online resource (ii, 22 pages) :billustrations (some color)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext file2rdaft  bPDF  bM.S.cUniversity of Washingtond2020.  aIncludes bibliographical references (pages 20-21).3 aThe extracellular matrix (ECM) exhibits constant physiochemical changes throughout all biological processes, including organ development, maintenance of tissue homeostasis, and disease progression/ healing.

However, the requirements of cell harvesting, in vitro expansion, cell seeding, maturation in bioreactors, and decellularization involved in traditional tissue engineering often make the time and costs for engineering tissues unaffordable to patients. As a result, there's currently no tissue engineered product that withstands the test of the market, hindering the delivery of the promise of regeneration to patients. In situ tissue engineering, by recruiting cells from the body directly to the site to be regenerated and using the body as the bioreactor, bypasses all the in vitro works, eliminating the time and costs associated with them. Thus such an approach is more likely to be translational. The research from the Ratner Lab has demonstrated that precision-engineered porous material with pore sizes in the range of 30-40 [micro]m maximizes the recruitment of macrophages which in turn orchestrate blood vessels and other tissues to integrate into the material. Here, we focus on in situ tissue engineered vascular grafts using such angiogenic and regenerative materials for the replacement of blood vessels. First, we developed a biostable elastic polymer (elastomer) with tunable mechanical property able to match that of the native blood vessels. Second, we demonstrated, in a mouse subcutaneous implant model, the precision-engineered elastomer eliminates the foreign body capsule (FBC) and maximizes the ingrowth of capillary blood vessels. Such effects are accompanied and potentially explained by the increase of macrophage recruitment and the decrease of inflammatory macrophages. Third, we manufactured the vascular graft by integrating the porous elastomer, a reinforcement fabric, and a sealant with tunable degradation rate. Fourth, we are conducted short-term implantation studies in both pig and sheep models. We hypothesize that, combining the pro-angiogenic effect, matching mechanical property, and reduction of FBC, our vascular graft will improve healing and reduce intimal hyperplasia (IH). Our first target for clinical application is to improve the performance of vascular grafts for hemodialysis access, which currently have a failure rate of 50% within the first year. If proven successful, such vascular graft can be easily applied to address to broad clinical problems of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) that are responsible for one in every three deaths. The strategy of co-optimizing porous structure, mechanical property, and bio-degradability is also being applied to developing skin grafts and grafts for regeneration after spinal cord injury (SCI).0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed May 18, 2020). 0aVascular grafts. 0aTissue engineering. 0aElastomers. 0aBiomedical materials. 7aVascular grafts.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01164501 7aTissue engineering.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01151484 7aElastomers.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00904231 7aBiomedical materials.2fast0(OCoLC)fst008325860 aForeign body reaction0 aHealing0 aImmunomudulation0 aSheep0 aTissue engineering0 aVascular graft0 aChemical engineering 4aThesesxChemical engineering. 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aRatner, B.

Novel materials such as conducting polymer and perovskite are developed to replace the traditional group III-V inorganic materials and counter the new challenges. Ultraviolet (UV) photodetectors play a critical role in scientific, commercial, civil, and military areas. Perovskite materials with tunable bandgap have been successfully applied to fabricate high-performance solar cells. However, their potential for UV detection has not been demonstrated yet. In this work, pinhole-free methylammonium lead trichloride (CH₃NH₃PbCl₃) perovskite thin films were fabricated via a two-step spin coating and solvent-vapor-assisted thermal annealing method under low temperature for the first time. Prototypical UV photodetectors based on CH₃NH₃PbCl₃ perovskite thin films were fabricated and showed strong photoresponse in the 300-400 nm region. All the results demonstrated that low-temperature solution-processed CH₃NH₃PbCl₃ perovskite thin films offer great potential for making flexible, lightweight visible-blind UV-A photodetectors. Narrowband UV photodetectors are highly desired in multiple areas. Photodetectors based on organic-inorganic nanocomposite offer high sensitivity, widely adjustable response range, lightweight, and low-temperature solution processibility. However, the broad absorption range of organic and inorganic semiconductor materials make it difficult to achieve a narrowband detection feature. Nanocomposite thin films containing the conjugated polymer poly[(9,9-dioctylfluorenyl-2,7-diyl)-alt-co-(bithiophene)] (F8T2) blended with ZnO nanoparticles (NPs) were applied as the active layers of the photodetectors. Narrowband UV photodetectors with high gain and low driving voltage were demonstrated by adopting a symmetric device structure, controlling the active layer composition and microstructure, and manipulating the light penetration depth in the active layer. Our method offers a pathway to design and fabricate narrowband UV photodetectors. Hybrid organic-inorganic perovskite has shown its potential as high-performance solar cell active layer. However, its instability, including intrinsic and operational instability, strongly hinders its real-life applications. Two types of methylammonium (MA)-free, formamidinium (FA)-based perovskite, Rb₀.₀₅Cs₀.₁FA₀.₈₅PbI₃ and Cs₀.₁₅FA₀.₈₅PbI₃, was fabricated and the effect of Rb⁺ on the device performance and long-term stability were investigated. By simply mixing the precursor solution before spin coating, the defect states in both types of perovskite were significantly reduced and device stabilities against the electric field were improved. The modified precursor solution provided devices with Rb₀.₀₅Cs₀.₁FA₀.₈₅PbI₃ and Cs₀.₁₅FA₀.₈₅PbI₃ active layer that retained 68% and 92% of their initial PCE, respectively, over 30 days under N₂ protection. The work sheds a light on the solution of the operational instability of perovskite solar cells and paves the pathway for their industrialization. To further improve the optoelectronic device performance based on poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) conducting polymer, a hydroxymethyl (-MeOH) and chloromethyl (-MeCl) function group was introduced to the oxyethylene ring of EDOT monomer. Oxidative chemical polymerization was applied to synthesize PEDOT:PSS and functionalized PEDOT:PSS. The polymerization mechanism of PEDOT:PSS and effects of functional group on the polymerization were revealed. The study sheds light on the polymerization of PEDOT with functional groups and provides a guideline for the synthesis of functionalized PEDOT conducting polymers with polyelectrolyte counterions using oxidative chemical polymerization.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed September 21, 2020). 0aOptoelectronic devices. 0aThin films. 0aPerovskite. 0aMethylaminesxDerivatives. 7aThin films.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01150018 7aPerovskite.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01058323 7aOptoelectronic devices.2fast0(OCoLC)fst010469080 aEngineering0 aChemical engineering 4aThesesxChemical engineering. 7aAcademic theses2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aYu, Qiuming,d1963-edegree supervisor.40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/45884  aWAUW04243cam a2200481Ii 45000010011000000080041000110060019000520050017000710070014000880400044001021000034001462450133001802640063003132640011003763000083003873360026004703370026004963380036005223470021005583470008005795000010005875020044005975040055006415202466006965880098031626500026032606500016032866500020033026500042033226500046033646500052034106530018034626530019034806530025034996530017035246530022035416550034035636550047035976550028036447000043036728560037037150490009037521128832580191125t20192019waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20200714225941.3cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdOCLCFdWAUdOCL1 aAdelmund, Steven M.,eauthor.10aSpatiotemporally resolved proteomics and dynamic biomaterial control through bioorthogonal photochemistry /cSteven M.

Though all cells within an organism share a common genome, differential expression of genes into proteins regulate developmental processes, tissue morphogenesis and function, disease susceptibility and response, and a wide variety of intra- and extra-cellular signaling events. This thesis introduces the first tools for spatiotemporally resolved proteomics, enabling visualization and quantification of proteins produced in vitro and in vivo within user-defined regions of time and 3D space (i.e., 4D). Light-activated bioorthogonal non-canonical amino acid tagging (laBONCAT) exploits the photouncaging of a reactive amino acid prior to translational incorporation, while photoactivated in vitro/vivo tagging (PAINT) utilizes light to spatially tag proteins that were previously metabolically labeled. In both cases, affinity purification and quantitative mass spectrometric analysis permits 4D mapping of global protein production within living samples. Relying on bioorthogonal photochemistries that can be performed on demand and with single-micron resolution, this work demonstrates the ability to label newly synthesized proteins in 2D/3D culture and in zebrafish models with subcellular resolution. This unique approach is likely to prove useful in determining new diagnostic markers for disease, as well as expanding our knowledge of fundamental biology. Recognizing the precise 4D control that photochemistry affords, this thesis further expands the toolbox of photochemical reactions available, creating biomaterials whose chemical and physical properties can be modulated in a wavelength-dependent manner. Here, a photoorthogonal reaction scheme is introduced that combines photocleavable linkers based on ortho-nitrobenzyl ester (oNB) and a boron-dipyrromethene (BODIPY) that respond to UV and visible light, respectively. oNB remains undisturbed under 505 nm irradiation, while BODIPY undergoes rapid photolysis. Although BODIPY also cleaves with 365 nm irradiation, its comparative slow degradation kinetics permit reaction orthogonality with oNB under physiological conditions. This pair permits on-demand and spatially defined regulation of protein presentation within and degradation of hydrogel biomaterials, providing exciting opportunities for controlled drug delivery and tissue engineering applications.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed November 25, 2019). 0aBiomedical materials. 0aProteomics. 0aPhotochemistry. 7aProteomics.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01079785 7aPhotochemistry.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01061514 7aBiomedical materials.2fast0(OCoLC)fst008325860 aBioorthogonal0 aPhotochemistry0 aChemical engineering0 aBiochemistry0 aOrganic chemistry 4aThesesxChemical engineering. 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aDeForest, Cole A.,edegree supervisor.40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/44744  aWAUW02339cam a2200481Ii 4500001001000000008004100010006001900051005001700070007001400087040007900101100002700180245009900207264006300306264001100369300005900380336002600439337002600465338003600491347002100527347000800548502004800556504005500604520052700659588009601186650002501282650005301307650003201360650001601392650004201408650005101450653001201501653002901513653001901542653001601561653001201577653002501589655003401614655004701648655002801695700008801723856003701811049000901848956509051160811t20162016waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20210721171419.5cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdOCLCOdOCLCFdWAUdOCLCAdOCLCQdOCLCOdWAUdOCLCO1 aAi, Jia-Ruey,eauthor.10aMixed-charge copolymer as environmentally friendly low fouling marine coatings /cJia-Ruey Ai. 1a[Seattle] :b[University of Washington Libraries],c[2016] 4c©2016  a1 online resource (v, 21 pages) :bcolor illustrations  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext file2rdaft  bPDF  bM.S.

In accommodating this demand for growth, we explore the possibility that the Car9 affinity tag, a silica-binding dodecamer, may provide an inexpensive alternative to the current gold-standard, the hexahistidine tag. Specifically, we show that the Car9 extension, which was previously shown to be functional as a C-terminal affinity tag, supports rapid purification when appended to the N-terminus of proteins, yielding a>85% purity in a manner of minutes. In addition, we demonstrate two novel methods of Car9 tag removal using the outer-membrane protease, OmpT. The first involves the use of OmpT-overproducing E. coli cells crosslinked to chitosan microspheres using glutaraldehyde. The second employs a mutated version of purified Ompt that is itself modified with a Car9 tag. We show that the immobilized cells support complete excision of a C-terminal Car9 tag in 24h of incubation with no contaminant formation. These catalytic microspheres are reusable, storable, and show promise for larger scale experiments. An OmpT-Car9 fusion protein refolded from inclusion bodies was also shown to support Car9 tag cleavage, and removal with silica. However, further experimentation will be required to determine binding affinity of OmpT-Car9 for future purification and retrieval optimization experiments.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed August 11, 2016). 0aProteinsxPurification. 0aProteinsxAffinity labeling. 0aProteolytic enzymes. 0aMicrospheres. 7aMicrospheres.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01020099 7aProteinsxAffinity labeling.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01079713 7aProteinsxPurification.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01079750 7aProteolytic enzymes.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01079783  aAffinity Tag  aCar9  aChitosan  aMicrospheres  aOmpT  aSilica  aChemical engineering 4aThesesxChemical engineering. 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aBaneyx, François,edegree supervisor.40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/36521  aWAUW02871cam a2200505Ii 45000010011000000080041000110060019000520050017000710070014000880400065001021000030001672450114001972640063003112640011003743000060003853360026004453370026004713380036004973470021005333470008005545020048005625040055006105200991006655880093016566500046017496500046017956500022018416500072018636500048019356530020019836530016020036530019020196530021020386530009020596530020020686530021020886530024021096530025021336550033021586550047021916550028022387000053022668560037023190490009023561043359957180706t20182018waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20190504103329.9cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdOCLCOdOCLCFdWAUdOCLdOCLCQdOCLCO1 aAvadhoot, Rahul,eauthor.10aPyMolSAR :ba Python-based toolkit to predict the activity and property of small molecules /cRahul Avadhoot. 1a[Seattle] :b[University of Washington Libraries],c[2018] 4c©2018  a1 online resource (ii, 27 pages) :bcolor illustrations  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext file2rdaft  bPDF  bM.S.

However, building such models in Python is cumbersome for cheminformatics researchers as they must use several Python packages and undertake a sequence of modeling steps. For instance, use Python packages for calculating molecular descriptors and generating models. Therefore, a Python toolkit that integrates these Python packages and modeling steps will immensely benefit cheminformatics researchers. This work presents a Python toolkit, called PyMolSAR for building predictive structure-activity relationships models for small molecules. The functionality of PyMolSAR includes calculating 759 1D/2D molecular descriptors, data preprocessing, feature selection, training and evaluating predictive models.

Typical approaches, including systemic therapeutic administration and surgery, lack the precision required to effectively treat certain diseases. Biomaterials that dynamically sense and respond to critical aspects of their environment could enable new possibilities in targeted drug delivery, diagnostics, cell culture and regenerative medicine. However, there is not yet a framework for creating materials responsive to multiple inputs in a well-defined manner. This dissertation details the development of a modular biomaterial platform that can integrate multiple biochemical inputs to provide a functional output through Boolean computation. The connectivity and architecture of multiple stimuli-labile groups incorporated into a single linker determines its behavior upon the environmentally triggered cleavage of combinations of these moieties. To validate this framework we employed, light, reductant, and enzyme as inputs to create seventeen unique logically degradable hydrogels. The Boolean linkers were then used to govern the release of pendant proteins, small molecules, and therapeutics from non-degradable hydrogels. Finally, we exploited this system to enable logic-triggered activation of cell-penetrating peptides to regulate the cellular uptake of proteins.

This thesis summarizes the recent work in zwitterionic hydrogels. Firstly, zwitterionic hydrogel can repair itself independent of time after damage under physiological conditions due to a new mechanism, "zwitterionic fusion". In addition, we explored the properties of zwitterionic hydrogels in controlling the self-renewal and differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells. Finally, by developing a biodegradable zwitterionic hydrogel, we realized ex vivo expansion of mesenchymal stem cells and hematopoietic stem cells without differentiation.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed September 19, 2017). 0aPolyzwitterions. 0aBiomedical materials. 0aMesenchymal stem cellsxDifferentiation. 0aHematopoietic stem cells. 7aBiomedical materials.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00832586 7aHematopoietic stem cells.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00954931 7aMesenchymal stem cellsxDifferentiation.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01767960 7aPolyzwitterions.2fast0(OCoLC)fst017395290 aChemical engineering 4aThesesxChemical engineering 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aJiang, Shaoyi,d1964-edegree supervisor.1http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q8856592040uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/39977  aWAUW03894cam a2200541Ii 45000010011000000080041000110060019000520050017000710070014000880400044001021000033001462450097001792640063002762640011003393000066003503360026004163370026004423380036004683470021005043470008005255020044005335040055005775201894006325880098025266500021026246500024026456500030026696500036026996500050027356500062027856500047028476500056028946530018029506530021029686530021029896530023030106530022030336530026030556530022030816530028031036530025031316550034031566550047031906550028032377000041032658560037033060490009033431128832926191125t20192019waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20200714230024.9cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdOCLCFdWAUdOCL1 aBeckner, Wesley A.,eauthor.10aIonic liquid design using molecular simulation and statistical methods /cWesley A.

In the material domain presented in this work, ionic liquids (ILs), there are theoretically 1014-18 possible pairwise molecular structures-too many to synthesize exhaustively. For this particular design problem, we turn to computational approaches. But even here an exhaustive approach is intractable. A method of deciding what system to simulate in the first place must be optimized. There are many deterministic and stochastic algorithms available for such search spaces. The Darwinian processes of evolutionary algorithms (EAs), work by mutating a candidate solution until it attains a desired fitness. In this case, the fitness is determined by a quantitative structure property relationship (QSPR) usually in the form of a machine learning (ML) model. Because the ML model is based on learning examples, it pairs well with the search strategy of an EA-starting molecular configurations for the EA are based on the same examples that have informed the ML model. When a particular solution deviates far from the training data (i.e. its molecular structure is different than the structures of the molecules in the training data) the uncertainty estimate in its property prediction is high. When this occurs, the EA solution can be simulated in MD to either: a) explore the structure landscape and inform/update the model or b) exploit the structure landscape because the prediction is close to our target. The holy grail, however, of any material design process is to operate on smooth featural or structural surfaces, and therefore be able to calculate explicit gradients to iterate toward the target property in question. Such a design process is explored through the generative capabilities of a class of stochastic neural networks-variational autoencoders-for the explicit rationalization of desired IL thermodynamic properties.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed November 25, 2019). 0aIonic solutions. 0aSimulation methods. 0aEvolutionary computation. 0aMaterialsxMathematical models. 7aSimulation methods.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01119166 7aMaterialsxMathematical models.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01011852 7aIonic solutions.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00978618 7aEvolutionary computation.2fast0(OCoLC)fst009173380 aIonic liquids0 aMachine learning0 aMolecular design0 aMolecular dynamics0 aSearch algorithms0 aStatistical mechanics0 aMaterials Science0 aComputational chemistry0 aChemical engineering 4aThesesxChemical engineering. 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aPfaendtner, Jim,edegree supervisor.40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/44742  aWAUW04016cam a2200505Ii 4500001001000000008004100010006001900051005001700070007001400087040006000101100003600161245017000197264006300367264001100430300006200441336002600503337002600529338003600555347002400591502004800615504005500663520207700718588009602795650002102891650002202912650002002934650002402954650004702978650004603025650004803071650005003119653001403169653001603183653001503199653002303214653002503237653002603262653002303288655003403311655004703345655002803392700004403420856003703464049000903501956508277160811t20162016waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20190619182451.8cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdOCLCOdOCLCFdWAUdOCLCQdOCLCO1 aBlanchfield, Julie E.,eauthor.10aCharacterization and degradation of fatty acid methyl esters and biodiesel in artificial seawater under UV exposure using Raman spectroscopy /cJulie E.

Most of the world's commodities are shipped over the oceans by large cargo vessels and the carriage of potentially hazardous cargo has safety and environmental risks. The carriage of biofuels is becoming more commonplace and an environmental discharge of such fuels is a potential given international allowances for cargo tank cleaning. The fate of biodiesel in the marine environment is a newer focus of research as the industry expands. This research characterizes the vibrational modes of the building blocks of biodiesel (fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs)) and a commercial biodiesel sample through Raman spectroscopy. The concentration sensitivity of the Raman spectroscope in concentrations of ultra-pure and artificial seawater was found to be low; concentrations of 20% oil in water were necessary for good spectral resolution. Commercial biodiesel in artificial seawater was exposed under a UV lamp for 23 days to evaluate the degradation mechanisms. Isomerization was evidenced by the decline of the cis configurational vibration modes of the =CH bends. Photo-oxidation was apparent as the samples' double bonds broke down over time. It was shown from comparison with a lab-made FAME mix that the antioxidants in commercial biodiesel slowed this process considerably. Hydrolysis occurred breaking down the biodiesel's FAMEs into their relative free fatty acid and methanol. Methanol evaporated significantly from the sample; its presence was not measured directly through Raman spectroscopy but through a literature review and evaluation of vapor pressures, it was shown that methanol formed. The toxicity of methanol is a concern to marine organisms; however if most of the methanol formed through this degradation evaporates and exists the marine environment through natural physical oceanographic and transport processes, it is unlikely that biodiesel residue into the ocean will cause measurable harm to aquatic organisms.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed August 11, 2016). 0aBiodiesel fuels. 0aPhotodegradation. 0aPhotochemistry. 0aRaman spectroscopy. 7aBiodiesel fuels.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00832010 7aPhotochemistry.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01061514 7aPhotodegradation.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01742442 7aRaman spectroscopy.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01089674  aBiodiesel  aDegradation  aPhotolysis  aRaman spectroscopy  aChemical engineering  aChemical oceanography  aAlternative energy 4aThesesxChemical engineering. 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aYu, Qiuming,d1963-edegree supervisor.40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/36524  aWAUW05996cam a2200529Ii 4500001001000000008004100010006001900051005001700070007001400087040005300101100003200154245012000186246012400306264006300430264001100493300006200504336002600566337002600592338003600618347001900654347000800673502004300681504005700724520394600781588009804727650003004825650003504855650002404890650002204914650005004936650004804986650005605034653001605090653002105106653002905127653001805156653002105174653001805195653002505213653002705238655003405265655004705299655002805346700004605374856003705420049000905457964633570161130t20162016waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20190717165604.3cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdOCLCFdWAUdOCLCQdOCLCO1 aBorysiak, Mark D.,eauthor.10aPoint-­of-­care nucleic acid diagnostics using isotachophoresis and isothermal amplification /cMark D.

NAAT offer high diagnostic sensitivity and specificity that lead to confident diagnoses, as well as relatively fast results and diverse functionality (e.g. quantification, multiplexing). Despite the advantages of nucleic acid amplification tests, they currently have limited point-of-care (POC) utility due to the need for multi-step procedures and complex instruments that require skilled personnel and well-equipped laboratories. In this thesis, we aim to create integrated nucleic acid amplification technologies that are better suited for POC applications by developing devices that integrate unique sample preparation and amplification techniques. Specifically, we use a powerful electrokinetic method called isotachophoresis (ITP) to rapidly extract and concentrate nucleic acids using two buffers and an electric field. We also replace traditional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification with isothermal amplification methods that do not require thermocycling equipment. We present two devices that use isotachophoresis and isothermal amplification to extract and amplify nucleic acids from complex samples. The first technology is named the NAIL device--Nucleic acid Amplification using Isotachophoresis and Loop-mediated isothermal amplification. NAIL uses ITP and loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) to extract and amplify nucleic acids from complex matrices in less than one hour inside of an integrated chip. Fluid actuation is performed by passive capillary barriers and heated air chambers that act as valves and pumps respectively. LAMP amplifies nucleic acids at constant temperature and produces a bright fluorescent signal that can be detected using a mobile phone camera equipped with fluorescent filters. We show the limit of detection (LoD) of pathogenic E. coli O157:H7 cells from whole milk samples to be 1000 CFU/mL, which is a two orders of magnitude improvement to standard tube-LAMP reactions with diluted milk samples. The second device is called ITP-RPA, which combines isotachophoresis with the isothermal amplification strategy, recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA). This device offers improvements over NAIL because it simultaneously incorporates sample extraction with amplification, removing the need for any pumps, valves, etc. ITP-RPA offers detection of nucleic acids in less than 15-20 minutes, and uses low-cost glass fiber substrates that make it amenable to POC applications. We show the detection of nucleic acids spiked into serum and whole blood as we work towards creating a POC viral load monitoring diagnostic for HIV-1 antiretroviral therapy treatments. We discuss the design of ITP chemistry that can incorporate the reagents required for RPA, as well as how to adapt this chemistry for separating the reaction from sample inhibitors. We show the current LOD of the device to be 10,000 copies/mL in serum, which is one order of magnitude higher than the clinical threshold. Future work will aim to improve this value below the relevant threshold. The introduction to these thesis discusses diagnostic devices with a focus on nucleic acid diagnostics. It also presents the descriptions and relevant principles for ITP and isothermal amplification. Chapter 2 reviews and summarizes relevant metrics for developing diagnostic devices in the laboratory, as well as transitioning these devices to the clinic. Appreciating and using these metrics will benefit test developers by providing consistent measures to evaluate analytical and clinical assay performance, as well as guide the design of tests that will most benefit clinicians and patients. Discussion topics include analytical laboratory statistics, diagnostic sensitivity/specificity and clinical thresholds, clinical metrics, and case studies from relevant commercially available tests.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed November 30, 2016). 0aNucleic acidsxSynthesis. 0aNucleic acidsxDiagnostic use. 0aGene amplification. 0aIsotachophoresis. 7aGene amplification.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00939610 7aIsotachophoresis.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00980217 7aNucleic acidsxSynthesis.2fast0(OCoLC)fst010410840 aDiagnostics0 aIsotachophoresis0 aIsothermal Amplification0 aNucleic Acids0 aPaper substrates0 aPoint-of-care0 aChemical engineering0 aBiomedical engineering 4aThesesxChemical engineering. 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aPosner, Jonathan Dov,edegree supervisor.40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/37050  aWAUW03560cam a2200469Ii 45000010011000000080041000110060019000520050017000710070014000880400044001021000028001462450131001742640063003052640011003683000071003793360026004503370026004763380036005023470021005383470008005595000010005675020044005775040041006215201823006625880097024856500035025826500023026176500016026406500061026566500049027176500042027666530022028086530018028306530025028486530011028736550028028846550034029126550047029467000051029938560037030440490009030811083644030190130t20182018waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20190731191923.8cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdOCLCFdWAUdOCL1 aBraly, Ian L.,eauthor.10aOptoelectronic quality and stability of hybrid perovskites determined by steady-state luminescence techniques /cIan L.

In particular, inorganic-organic lead halide perovskites are well suited for converting the sun's rays into electrical power. In addition to having the right light-absorbing and charge-carrier transport properties, hybrid perovskites may be synthesized via facile solution-based deposition techniques and demonstrate notably low amounts of heat-generating losses under illumination. Even polycrystalline films cast from hand-made inks can sustain very high concentrations of light-generated charge carriers, and in turn sustain large open-circuit voltages. Further, the three-component formula of ABX3 (A = monovalent cation, B = divalent metal, C = halide) makes the composition space for hybrid perovskites enormous. Each component can be alloyed to tune the bandgap for either single-junction or two-junction applications. In this dissertation, several methods centered around steady-state photoluminescence are detailed for characterizing this new class of materials. We explore the impact of composition, illumination time, charge-injection, and atmospheric conditions on the optoelectronic quality and stability of hybrid perovskites. We show that absolute intensity steady-state photoluminescence measurements of neat hybrid perovskite thin-films modeled with the Lasher-Stern-Würfel equation enables reliable prediction of device open-circuit voltages. Combinatorial spray coating and photoluminescence mapping of halide alloys reveals that the optoelectronic quality decreases with increasing bromide concentration. Finally, we present a scalable analysis tool-kit to analyze wide-field microscope videos of hybrid perovskite thin-film photoluminescence flickering.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed January 30, 2019). 0aPhotovoltaic cellsxMaterials. 0aPhotoluminescence. 0aPerovskite. 7aPhotovoltaic cellsxMaterials.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01062160 7aPhotoluminescence.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01062036 7aPerovskite.2fast0(OCoLC)fst010583230 aPhotoluminescence0 aPhotovoltaics0 aChemical engineering0 aEnergy 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft 4aThesesxChemical engineering. 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst017264531 aHillhouse, Hugh W.,d1972-edegree supervisor.40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/42994  aWAUW04211cam a2200445Ii 4500001001000000008004100010006001900051005001700070007001400087040006700101100003100168245012300199264006300322264001100385300006300396336002600459337002600485338003600511347002400547500001000571502004300581504005700624520257000681588009603251650002003347650004603367653001203413653002503425653003203450653002203482653002303504653001303527653002503540655003403565655004703599655002803646700004503674856003703719049000903756956508273160811t20162016waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20190619182532.7cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdOCLCOdOCLCFdWAUdOCLCAdOCLCQdOCLCO1 aBraun, Trevor M.,eauthor.10aRemote control electrodeposition :bpatterning on substrates without direct electrical connections /cTrevor M.

Wiring to a substrate is especially difficult for micro/nano-manufactured systems or complex three-dimensional geometries. Bipolar electrochemistry involves spatially segregated, equal and opposite reduction and oxidation on an electrically floating substrate. We show that spatial and temporal control of bipolar electrochemical couples enables patterned electrodeposition (or etching) by "remote control" without wiring to the substrate. The driving force for bipolar electrochemistry is the potential variation in solution when a current is passed; solution potential variation creates regions of differing electrochemical behavior (oxidation or reduction) on a single conducting substrate. Bipolar electrochemistry has intricate mating between the thermodynamics of the bipolar electrochemical reactions, their charge transfer kinetics, and ionic migration through the electrochemical cell. We characterize local bipolar electrodeposition beneath the tip of a rastering microjet anode configuration we call a scanning bipolar cell (SBC). The fundamental interactions of thermodynamics, kinetics, and transport in the SBC are first explored using local cupric ion and nickel ion reduction to metal beneath the microjet, with concomitant oxidation of the copper substrate as the bipolar counter reaction. The bipolar current efficiency (BCE, the fraction of the applied current that flows through the unwired substrate) can be near unity under certain electrolyte and operating conditions. Advanced electrolyte design enables a wide variety of local electrodeposition chemistries (Ni, Cu, Au, and Ag) on an inert gold substrate; the bipolar counter reaction (ascorbic acid or ferrous ion oxidation) involves a far-field oxidation that leaves the gold substrate unchanged. Simple linearized scaling arguments capture the relationship between tool and electrolyte traits, enabling a 10X improvement in spatial resolution, down to the motion control limit of our device. But, scaling arguments over-predict the BCE compared to experimental values. Electroanalytical measurements of the bipolar electrolytes provide fundamental data that underpins more sophisticated simulations. Finite element method computations are used to explain where simple scaling relationships breakdown. The impact of local bipolar electrodeposition in printed circuit board repair, additive manufacturing, and electroanalytical research is discussed.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed August 11, 2016). 0aElectroplating. 7aElectroplating.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00907715  aBipolar  aCurrent Distribution  aElectrochemical Engineering  aElectrodeposition  aElectrolyte Design  aScanning  aChemical engineering 4aThesesxChemical engineering. 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aSchwartz, Daniel T.,edegree supervisor.40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/36525  aWAUW04574cam a2200445Ii 45000010011000000080041000110060019000520050017000710070014000880400065001021000042001672450098002092640063003072640011003703000063003813360026004443370026004703380036004963470021005323470008005535020043005615040041006045202937006455880092035826500051036746500077037256530013038026530015038156530015038306530018038456530018038636530025038816530022039066550033039286550047039616550028040087000046040368560037040820490009041191033544303180501t20172017waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20190501211242.0cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdOCLCOdOCLCFdWAUdOCLdOCLCQdOCLCO1 aCaldwell, Kyle Bernd,d1988-eauthor.10aAdhesion and interphase properties of reinforced polymeric composites /cKyle Bernd Caldwell. 1a[Seattle] :b[University of Washington Libraries],c[2017] 4c©2017  a1 online resource (xvii, 113 pages) :bcolor illustrations  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext file2rdaft  bPDF  bPh.

Fiber reinforced polymeric composites, in particular, possess impressive mechanical properties at a fraction of the weight of many other building materials. There will always, however, be a demand for producing lighter, stiffer, and stronger materials. Understanding the mechanism of adhesion and ways to engineer the reinforcement-matrix interphase can lead to the development of new materials with improved mechanical properties, and even impart additional functionality such as electrical conductivity. The performance of reinforced polymeric composites is critically dependent upon the adhesion between the reinforcement and the surrounding polymer. The relative adhesion between a filler and a thermoplastic matrix can be predicted using calculable thermodynamic quantities such as the Gibbs free energy of mixing. A recent model, COSMO-SAC, is capable of predicting the adhesion between organo-silane treated glass surfaces and several thermoplastic materials. COSMO-SAC uses information based on the charge distribution of a molecule's surface to calculate many thermodynamic properties. Density functional theory calculations, which are relative inexpensive computations, generate the information necessary to perform the COSMO-SAC analysis and can be performed on any given molecule. The flexibility of the COSMO-SAC model is one of the main advantages it possesses over other methods for calculating thermodynamic quantities. In many cases the adhesion between a reinforcing fiber and the surrounding matrix may be improved by incorporating interphase modifiers in the vicinity of the fiber surface. The modifiers can improve the fracture toughness and modulus of the interphase, which may improve the stress transfer from the matrix to the fiber. In addition, the interphase modifiers may improve the mechanical interlock between the fiber surface and the bulk polymer, leading to improved adhesion. In recent years, the use of so called "migrating agents" have been used to self-assemble nanoparticle reinforced fiber-matrix interphases in thermosetting resin systems. The inclusion of a modest amount of thermoplastic migrating agent can lead to the formation of a self-assembled interphase, without causing aggregation of nanoparticles in the bulk phase. Formulations containing excess migrating agent, however, can induce aggregation in the bulk of increasing severity with increasing migrating agent concentration. Several techniques were used to study the mechanism by which the migrating agents operate including, scanning electron microscopy, and in situ fluorescence microscopy. The self-assembly mechanism by which migrating agents operate is described well by depletion forces, which are depend on the geometry of the approaching objects, as well as the migrating agent molecular weight and concentration.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed May 1, 2018). 0aPolymeric compositesxDesign and construction. 7aPolymeric compositesxDesign and construction.2fast0(OCoLC)fst010705600 aAdhesion0 aComposites0 aInterphase0 aNanoparticles0 aSelf-assembly0 aChemical engineering0 aMaterials Science 4aThesesxChemical engineering 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aBerg, John C.,d1937-edegree supervisor.40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/40856  aWAUW02452cam a2200469Ii 4500001001000000008004100010006001900051005001700070007001400087040007900101100002600180245007600206264006300282264001100345300003300356336002600389337002600415338003600441347002400477502004100501504005500542520053100597588009601128650002501224650003601249650004401285650002101329650003201350650007001382650006201452650005801514650005101572650004701623653002501670655003401695655004701729655002801776700008801804700004401892856003701936049000901973956508187160811t20162016waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20210721171422.1cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdOCLCOdOCLCFdWAUdOCLCAdOCLCQdOCLCOdWAUdOCLCO1 aChe, Xinran,eauthor.10aBioinspired anti-fouling coating on hydrophobic surfaces /cXinran Che. 1a[Seattle] :b[University of Washington Libraries],c[2016] 4c©2016  a1 online resource (37 pages)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext filebPDF2rda  bM.S.cUniversity of Washingtond2016  aIncludes bibliographical references (pages 35-37).3 aAnti-biofouling is very important in many applications ranging from marine coatings to biomedical devices.

Moderate to severe HIE is the major cause of morbidity and mortality in neonates around the time of birth. Current experimental evidence and clinical trials suggest that therapeutic hypothermia (TH) can reduce brain damage and improve neurological outcomes after neonatal hypoxic-ischemic (HI) injury. However, some infants still die and nearly half of affected infants continue to have significant brain injury in spite of treatment with TH. Therefore, additional treatment options should be explored. Curcumin has recently been found to have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects that may mitigate the outcomes of brain injury after perinatal asphyxia. Nonetheless, curcumin has low solubility and limited ability to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Several studies show that nanoparticles have the ability to cross the BBB, and incorporation of curcumin into a nanoparticle platform can overcome therapeutic limitations for effective use. After crossing the BBB, nanoparticles must have the ability to travel through the brain parenchyma to reach diseased cells and deliver a therapeutic. Previously it has been found that poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)-coated polystyrene particle less than 114 nm in diameter with a zeta ([zeta])-potential more neutral than -6 mV can penetrate within the brain parenchyma. Using this criteria, the biodegradable polymer methoxy(polyethylene glycol)-poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (mPEG-PLGA) was used to prepare curcumin-loaded nanoparticles. The impact of nanoparticle formulation parameters on nanoparticle' size and [zeta]-potential was investigated. Curcumin loading and curcumin release kinetics from the nanoparticle were also studied. In addition, nanoparticle transport behavior in a rat brain ex vivo model was studied using a high resolution multiple particle tracking technique. The brain localization and biodistribution of the nanoparticle and preliminary efficacy study of the curcumin-loaded nanoparticle was studied in a postnatal day 7 (P7) HI rat model. It was found that the nanoprecipitation method is a feasible method to formulate both curcumin-loaded mPEG5k-PLGA45k (50:50) and PLGA45k (50:50) nanoparticles with 5 - 6% curcumin loading. mPEG5k-PLGA45k (50:50) surface-coated with 1% F127 had better mobility within the brain parenchyma than PLGA45k (50:50) and both nanoparticles had good stability and sustained curcumin release within 24 hours. Preliminary results also showed that mPEG5k-PLGA45k (50:50) was able to get into the brain and curcumin-loaded mPEG5k-PLGA45k (50:50) increased curcumin passage across the BBB and reduced neuronal injury in the HIE rat model. 0aCurcuminxTherapeutic usexControlled release. 0aPolymeric drug delivery systems. 0aNanoparticles. 0aHypoxic-ischemic encephalopathyxChemotherapy. 7aNanoparticles.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01032624 7aPolymeric drug delivery systems.2fast0(OCoLC)fst010705740 aCurcumin0 aDrug delivery0 aHypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy0 aNanoparticle0 aChemical engineering 4aThesesxChemical engineering 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aNance, Elizabeth,d1985-edegree supervisor.40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/39976  aWAUW
