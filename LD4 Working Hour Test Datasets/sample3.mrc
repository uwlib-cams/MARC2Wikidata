Nickel oxide (NiO[subscript]x) offers promising characteristics for a winning hole transport layer (HTL), such as high optical transmittance, high stability, easy processability, and a wide band gap that allows high hole mobility and good electron blocking ability. In this work, NiOx was synthesized by first forming Ni(OH)₂ in the precipitation reaction of (Ni(NO₃)₂· 6H₂O) and NaOH. The synthesized NiO[subscript]x nanocrystals was dissolved in DI water to different concentrations and used as a HTL in the inverted p-i-n CsSnI₃ PVSCs. The effects of annealing condition, concentration of NiO[subscript]x ink and spin speed on the NiOx film morphology and surface roughness were explored. In addition, CsSnI₃ thin films were fabricated to be the active layer and solar cells with the inverted structure were fabricated and tested.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed September 21, 2020). 0aPerovskite solar cells. 0aNickel oxide. 7aPerovskite solar cells.2fast0(OCoLC)fst02009247 7aNickel oxide.2fast0(OCoLC)fst018947720 aChemical engineering 4aThesesxChemical engineering. 7aAcademic theses2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aYu, Qiuming,d1963-edegree supervisor.40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/45886  aWAUW03505cam a2200505 i 45000010011000000080041000110060019000520050017000710070014000880400051001021000027001532450115001802640063002952640011003583000070003693360026004393370026004653380036004913470021005273470008005485020049005565040055006055201586006605880099022466500048023456500021023936500025024146500012024396500038024516500051024896500047025406500074025876530021026616530026026826530018027086530027027266530023027536530025027766550034028016550046028356550028028817000044029098560037029530490009029901195708110200914t20202020waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20210120172538.2cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdWAUdOCLCFdOCLdOCLCO1 aBoese, Julia,eauthor.10aExploiting the interactions of solid binding proteins with silica to form colloidal assemblies /cJulia Boese. 1a[Seattle] :b[University of Washington Libraries],c[2020] 4c©2020  a1 online resource (ix, 57 pages) :billustrations (chiefly color)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext file2rdaft  bPDF  bM.S.

When genetically encoded within proteins, SBPs can function as linkers to create hybrid materials comprising inorganic components and the proteins to which they are fused. Here, we show how such solid binding proteins may be employed to achieve dynamic control over the assembly and disassembly of silica nanoparticles and how the process is influenced by SBP sequence, insertion point within the protein, and solution conditions. Using fluorescent-resonant energy transfer (FRET), dynamic light scattering (DLS) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), we show that bifunctional derivatives of superfolder green fluorescent protein (sfGFP) engineered with two strong, or with a strong and a weak silica-binding peptide support the pH-dependent aggregation and disaggregation of rhodamine-containing silica nanoparticle (RhSiNP). We further demonstrate that pH shifts can be used to cycle nanoparticles between assembled and dispersed states and that aggregate size can be tuned with different SBPs, NP sizes, and salt concentrations. Additionally, we designed multimeric de novo and natural proteins for increased control over the pattering of silica nanoparticles (SiNPs) and designed ZnS binding and cysteine binding sfGFP for the association of QDs into protein-linked nanomaterials. This new paradigm for the synthesis of dynamic nanoparticle systems should find applications in biosensing, diagnostics, and advanced materials.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed September 14, 2020). 0aPeptidesxStructure-activity relationships. 0aProtein binding. 0aProtein engineering. 0aSilica. 7aSilica.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01118585 7aProtein engineering.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01079685 7aProtein binding.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01079673 7aPeptidesxStructure-activity relationships.2fast0(OCoLC)fst010575790 aHybrid materials0 aNanomaterial assembly0 aNanoparticles0 aSolid Binding peptides0 aStimuli dependence0 aChemical engineering 4aThesesxChemical engineering. 7aAcademic theses2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aBaneyx, François,edegree supervisor.40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/45876  aWAUW02955cam a2200505 i 45000010011000000080041000110060019000520050017000710070014000880400051001021000036001532450078001892640063002672640011003303000060003413360026004013370026004273380036004533470021004893470008005105020042005185040055005605201144006155880099017596500029018586500014018876500018019016500017019196500043019366500040019796500044020196530033020636530024020966530027021206530036021476530019021836530025022026530025022276550034022526550046022866550028023327000040023608560040024000490009024401196340746200921t20202020waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20210120172829.0cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdOCLCFdWAUdOCLdOCLCO1 aBonageri, Shrilakshmi,eauthor.10aData classification in high throughput screening /cShrilakshmi Bonageri. 1a[Seattle] :b[University of Washington Libraries],c[2020] 4c©2020  a1 online resource (ix, 79 pages) :bcolor illustrations  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext file2rdaft  bPDF  bM.S.cUniversity of Washingtond2020.  aIncludes bibliographical references (pages 76-79).3 aRedox flow batteries offer an economical, low vulnerability means to store electrical energy at grid scale. Most commercial flow batteries use concentrated sulphuric acid with vanadium as the active redox material. While they have many inherent benefits, the use of vanadium drives up their cost. Deep eutectic solvents (DESs) are promising electrolyte solvents for less expensive and more sustainable organic redox species due to their biodegradability, low cost, high solvent quality and molecular versatility. High throughput screening (HTS) was used to synthesize and measure thermal and electrochemical properties of DESs to rapidly find an optimum DES for use in redox flow batteries. As a vast amount of data with varying characteristics based on the samples being tested is produced, data classification is essential to automate data analysis. Thus, convolutional neural networks and long short term memory networks were successfully used to classify HTS data into predefined categories and eliminate noisy data. Suitable data analysis techniques were then developed for each category of classified data to obtain accurate results.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed September 21, 2020). 0aFlow batteriesxTesting. 0aSolvents. 0aElectrolytes. 0aVoltammetry. 7aVoltammetry.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01168951 7aSolvents.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01125677 7aElectrolytes.2fast0(OCoLC)fst009064890 aConvolutional neural network0 aData classification0 aDeep eutectic solvents0 aHigh throughput experimentation0 aNeural network0 aRedox flow batteries0 aChemical engineering 4aThesesxChemical engineering. 7aAcademic theses2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aPozzo, Lilo D.,edegree supervisor.4070uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/45888  aWAUW02676cam a2200469 i 45000010011000000080041000110060019000520050017000710070014000880400051001020660007001531000034001602450070001942640063002642640011003273000067003383360026004053370026004313380036004573470021004933470008005145020049005225040055005715880087006266500026007136500032007396500044007716500058008156500052008736530016009256530018009416530021009596530022009806530025010026550034010276550046010616550028011077000058011358560037011938800967012300490009021971196340223200921t20202020waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20210120172747.7cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdOCLCFdWAUdOCLdOCLCO  c(S1 aChen, Guoyao,d1995-eauthor.12aA high-resolution 3D printable porous biomaterial /cGuoyao Chen. 1a[Seattle] :b[University of Washington Libraries],c[2020] 4c©2020  a1 online resource (vi, 40 pages) :billustrations (some color)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext file2rdaft  bPDF  bM.S.

A porous biomaterial with 40μm pore size has been found to have good performance in reducing the foreign body reaction upon implantation, and since the inner structure is regular, a stereolithography 3D printing system was tried to print this high-resolution structure. This work has demonstrated with the laser intensity at 1Ã 10-6% and the writing speed at 1mm/s, the top surface of this structure can be printed with the commercially available resin DS2000, but the side faces cannot be properly printed due to the photo sensitiveness of the resin. The top surface of a complex and large shape, an insulin pump catheter, was also printed well. A few 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) based formulas have also been tried in the printer, though further optimization is needed to accurately print high resolution structures with HEMA.  aWAUW03470cam a2200541 i 45000010011000000080041000110060019000520050017000710070014000880400051001021000035001532450141001882640063003292640011003923000067004033360026004703370026004963380036005223470021005583470008005795020042005875040057006295201496006865880099021826500016022816500035022976500024023326500032023566500042023886500061024306500058024916500050025496530007025996530013026066530011026196530007026306530007026376530018026446530022026626530011026846530025026956550034027206550046027546550028028007000051028288560040028790490009029191196339840200921t20202020waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20210120172953.3cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdOCLCFdWAUdOCLdOCLCO1 aChin, Jeffrey,d1988-eauthor.10aDouble cation substitution of CZTSSe constituents to reduce detrimental defects clusters and improve device performance /cJeffrey Chin. 1a[Seattle] :b[University of Washington Libraries],c[2020] 4c©2020  a1 online resource (30 unnumbered pages) :bcolor illustrations  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext file2rdaft  bPDF  bM.S.cUniversity of Washingtond2020.  aIncludes bibliographical references (pages [29-30]).3 aSolution processed thin-film photovoltaic (PV) technology is poised to be the future of manufacturing standard for commercially available solar energy modules due to the substantially low estimated capital expenditure (CAPEX) required. Over the decades, the concept of high efficiency CZTSSe has enticed researchers but always eluded their grasps. This report explores improving the device performance metrics of CZTSSe with the goal of improving the PCE in hopes that it become industrially disruptive to the currently adopted technologies. The approach taken in this research was to conduct double cation alloying with elements shown in literature to have beneficial impacts for CZTSSe device performance with the hypothesis that the combination would be complementary. First, we investigated the combination of small stoichiometric substitutions of Cu with Ag and Zn with Mn so that the resulting stoichiometry would resemble (Agx,Cu1-[subscript]x)2(Mn[subscript]yZn[subscript]1-y)Sn(S,Se)₄. Second we investigated the double cation substitution of Cu with Ag and Sn with Ge so that the already proven effects of Ge incorporation could be correlated with the effects of Ag. Collectively, the work included in this report demonstrates considerable progress exploring uncharted avenues toward increasing the performance of CZTSSe. By attempting a new approach to understanding optoelectronic performance and reliability in CZTSSe the goal of high efficiency CZTSSe may soon be attainable.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed September 21, 2020). 0aThin films. 0aPhotovoltaic power generation. 0aCopper-zinc alloys. 0aMetal oxide semiconductors. 7aThin films.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01150018 7aPhotovoltaic power generation.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01062167 7aMetal oxide semiconductors.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01017624 7aCopper-zinc alloys.2fast0(OCoLC)fst008785740 aAg0 aAlloying0 aCZTSSe0 aGe0 aMn0 aVoc deffiecit0 aMaterials Science0 aEnergy0 aChemical engineering 4aThesesxChemical engineering. 7aAcademic theses2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aHillhouse, Hugh W.,d1972-edegree supervisor.4070uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/45879  aWAUW03525cam a2200445 i 45000010011000000080041000110060019000520050017000710070014000880400051001021000028001532450084001812640063002652640011003283000066003393360026004053370026004313380036004573470021004933470008005145020049005225040055005715201883006265880099025096500015026086500013026236500015026366500027026516500039026786500041027176500053027586500041028116530025028526550034028776550046029116550028029577000048029858560037030330490009030701195712907200914t20202020waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20210120172459.1cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdWAUdOCLCFdOCLdOCLCO1 aGu, Ge,d1996-eauthor.10aSupercritical fluid-liquid-solid growth of alloyed Si1-xGex nanowires /cGe Gu. 1a[Seattle] :b[University of Washington Libraries],c[2020] 4c©2020  a1 online resource (v, 30 pages) :billustrations (some color)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext file2rdaft  bPDF  bM.S.

However, one significant challenge of their practical implementation is the large volume change associated with the insertion and extraction of lithium ions, which results in mechanical pulverization and capacity fade. Nanostructuring active material morphology has been demonstrated as a strategy to compensate for volume change and improve capacity and cycle life in lithium ion batteries. Although Si has the highest theoretical capacity among elemental lithium ion battery negative electrodes and maintains distinct advantages as an electrode material, silicon's rate capability is hindered by its lower ionic diffusivity and electronic conductivity in comparison to Ge. However, Ge is much more expensive, which could limit its widespread use in anodes for lithium ion batteries. In an effort to capitalize on the benefits of both materials, there has been recent interest in developing an anode that combines the excellent rate capability of Ge with the high capacity and lower cost of Si. Recent efforts have demonstrated the ability to synthesize alloyed Si1-xGex nanowires (NWs) via a solution-based mechanism, using a thin film of tin to seed nanowire growth. In order to improve the scalability of this process, here we report the supercritical fluid-based synthesis of Sn nanocrystal-seeded alloyed Si1-xGex NWs. By balancing reaction parameters such as precursor reactivity, the semiconductor precursor to metal seed ratio, Si:Ge precursor ratio, and reaction temperature, we demonstrate the ability to synthesize alloyed Si1-xGex NWs through a colloidal, supercritical fluid-based process for the first time.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed September 14, 2020). 0aNanowires. 0aSilicon. 0aGermanium. 0aLithium ion batteries. 7aSilicon.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01118631 7aNanowires.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01032641 7aLithium ion batteries.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01764640 7aGermanium.2fast0(OCoLC)fst009420780 aChemical engineering 4aThesesxChemical engineering. 7aAcademic theses2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aHolmberg, Vincent Carl,edegree supervisor.40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/45877  aWAUW04694cam a2200397 i 45000010011000000080041000110060019000520050017000710070014000880400051001020660007001531000035001602450110001952640063003052640011003683000068003793360026004473370026004733380036004993470021005353470008005565020049005645040055006135880099006686500057007676500037008246500063008616530025009246550034009496550046009836550028010297000048010578560037011058803145011420490009042871196340715200921t20202020waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20210115175134.5cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdOCLCFdWAUdOCLdOCLCO  c(S1 aHsu, Chih-Wei,d1995-eauthor.10aData science approaches for tracking electrochemical reactions and phase transformations /cChih-Wei Hsu. 1a[Seattle] :b[University of Washington Libraries],c[2020] 4c©2020  a1 online resource (vii, 42 pages) :billustrations (some color)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext file2rdaft  bPDF  bM.S.

However, fully utilizing the data obtained via battery characterization, particularly battery cycling can be difficult, because so many data points are produced during battery cycling. A more recent innovation in battery characterization is to leverage data science to more fully utilize information obtained during various battery cycling protocols. Herein, we introduce two examples of using data science approaches combined with the battery characterization to maximize the value of the characterization data: total differential capacity (dQ/dV) plots and galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT). Total differential capacity plots are a powerful tool for understanding battery degradation when combined with various characterization techniques. However, due to the large amount of data, it is difficult to obtain quantitative conclusions via visual analysis, the typical approach for total differential capacity analysis. As a result, a data science approach was proposed to support quantitative conclusions for total differential capacity analysis. Herein, a software package has been developed to quantitatively analyze the battery cycling data from the dQ/dV plots. In addition, a user interface was built up and some documentations and demonstrations were set up to help the users have a better understanding of the codes and make it more accessible to use. Besides the application in tracking the electrochemical reactions within the battery, data science can also be combined with GITT to extract thermodynamic and kinetic data from a battery. This work focuses on generalizing a previously developed novel GITT model that accurately determined the lithium ion diffusions coefficient for a two-phase lithium iron phosphate electrode, so that the model can readily be applied to any phase transformation battery electrode (LiFePO₄) system. We validate our generalized tool both by replicating the data from the previous work and using the generalized tool to determine the sodium ions diffusion coefficients in the two-phase region during the sodium antimonide (Na₃Sb) battery charge-discharge cycling. In the standard GITT diffusivity model, the diffusion coefficients can appear to be many of magnitude lower in the two-phase region. This apparent drop occurs because phase transformation is not considered in the GITT diffusivity model. Therefore, the novel phase transformation GITT diffusivity model that we develop into a tool in this work takes both the diffusion and the interface migration into account. By solving the 1-D diffusion partial differential equations (PDEs) with the corresponding moving boundary conditions, the concentration profile, and the diffusion coefficients in both α and β phase can be determined. The diffusion coefficients obtained by the new model in the two-phase region are about 10⁻¹⁵~ 10⁻¹⁴ cm²/s for α and β phase, which is validated by the similarity of the diffusion coefficients calculated by the standard model in the single-phase region.  aWAUW04262cam a2200553 i 45000010011000000080041000110060019000520050017000710070014000880400058001021000025001602450111001852640063002962640011003593000093003703360026004633370026004893380036005153470021005513470008005725020044005805040057006245202183006815880094028646500041029586500019029996500018030186500021030366500068030576500047031256500067031726500045032396500044032846530018033286530012033466530019033586530018033776530022033956530025034176530025034426530018034676530019034856550034035046550047035386550028035857000049036138560037036620490009036991244817602210405t20202020waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20210714142827.9cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdOCLCOdOCLCFdWAUdOCLCOdOCL1 aLiao, Rick,eauthor.10aAntioxidant-loaded nanoparticles for the treatment of excitotoxicity in neurological disease /cRick Liao. 1a[Seattle] :b[University of Washington Libraries],c[2020] 4c©2020  a1 online resource (2 unnumbered pages, viii, 117 pages) :billustrations (chiefly color)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext file2rdaft  bPDF  bPh.

In acute neurological injury, a process known as excitotoxicity manifests from energy failure or direct trauma, causing overexcitation of neurons that leads to neuronal toxicity. Following neuronal death, toxic metabolites and cellular debris accumulate in the brain, perpetuating excitotoxicity to neighboring neurons. Despite the heavy social and economic toll and extensive research into neurotherapeutic development, there are currently no approved therapeutics for targeting excitotoxicity after acute neurological injury. The difficulty in clinical translation is largely attributed to several barriers intrinsic to the brain, including traversing the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and diffusion through the brain parenchyma. Therefore, in addition to understanding the biological complexity of the brain, developing effective therapeutics is a drug delivery problem. To expedite the pre-clinical research process, we have developed a tailorable organotypic whole hemisphere (OWH) brain slice model, capable of mimicking in vivo processes including excitotoxity and neuroinflammation. Using OWH models, we can systematically study disease processes and screen therapeutics in a high-throughput fashion, bypassing delivery obstacles. To improve therapeutic enzyme delivery, we have developed brain-penetrating antioxidant enzyme-loaded polymeric nanoparticles that inhibit enzymatic degradation. Furthermore, via nanoparticle screening on the OWH model, we have elucidated the toxicity of a common polymeric nanoparticle formulation involving poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) and sonication, and developed alternative biocompatible nanoparticle formulations. Finally, the OWH model has enabled detailed observation of disease-dependent nanoparticle-microglia interactions that can better inform drug delivery strategies. Throughout these studies, we have implemented a transdisciplinary approach that emphasizes thorough understanding of the neurobiology of disease and leverages chemical engineering fundamentals, to ultimately advance neurotherapeutic development.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed April 5, 2021). 0aNervous systemxDiseasesxTreatment. 0aNanoparticles. 0aAntioxidants. 0aNeurotoxicology.12aNervous System Diseasesxphysiopathology.0(DNLM)D009422Q000503 7aNeurotoxicology.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01036560 7aNervous systemxDiseasesxTreatment.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01036124 7aNanoparticles.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01032624 7aAntioxidants.2fast0(OCoLC)fst008106420 aDrug delivery0 aEnzymes0 aExcitotoxicity0 aNanoparticles0 aNeuroinflammation0 aNeurological disease0 aChemical engineering0 aNeurosciences0 aNanotechnology 4aThesesxChemical engineering. 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aNance, Elizabeth,d1985-edegree supervisor.40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/46396  aWAUW02132cam a2200409 i 45000010011000000080041000110060019000520050017000710070014000880400051001021000033001532450090001862640063002762640011003393000060003503360026004103370026004363380036004623470021004983470008005195020042005275040055005695200577006245880099012016500020013006500023013206500042013436500068013856500046014536530025014996550034015246550046015586550028016047000041016328560040016730490009017131196339786200921t20202020waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20210120172332.0cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdOCLCFdWAUdOCLdOCLCO1 aLiu, Kailei,d1994-eauthor.10aProtein-bound uremic toxin kinetics modeling for a new dialysis device /cKailei Liu. 1a[Seattle] :b[University of Washington Libraries],c[2020] 4c©2020  a1 online resource (iv, 21 pages) :bcolor illustrations  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext file2rdaft  bPDF  bM.S.cUniversity of Washingtond2020.  aIncludes bibliographical references (pages 19-21).3 aAddition to the conventional hemodialysis, a protein-bound uremic toxins process device is designed.

The electronic, optical, and mechanical properties of semiconductor nanowires can be considerably different than their bulk counterparts, making them attractive for a range of applications including sensors, energy storage, and quantum information systems. Solution-based synthesis is a promising strategy to produce semiconductor nanowires in a scalable, cost-effective matter. However, many solution-based methods are limited in their ability to produce nanowires with increasingly complex compositions-including doped, alloyed, and heterostructured architectures-as well as to rapidly screen synthetic parameters for combinatorial discovery and optimization. In addition, chemistries and growth dynamics can be difficult to track with nanowire syntheses that require high temperature and extreme pressure equipment. Moreover, the widespread integration of semiconductor nanowires into devices will also require new methods of assembly as well as careful consideration of surface chemistry. After an introduction to current methods of semiconductor nanowire synthesis, existing tactics for nanowire assembly, and strategies to improve the energy density of lithium ion batteries with group IV nanomaterials, this dissertation will cover three main topics related to (i) new synthetic methods for nanowire growth, (ii) a novel light-based nanowire assembly process, and (iii) the integration of nanowires into high-energy-density composite electrodes for lithium ion batteries. Herein, we demonstrate a new continuous-flow, laser-driven, nanowire growth process that exploits the light absorption of colloidal metal nanocrystals to drive semiconductor nanowire growth in an optically accessible reactor on the benchtop, potentially opening the door for both rapid screening of synthetic parameters as well as in situ studies of nanowire growth dynamics. Investigations of solution-based nanowire growth using this system establish that laser-driven syntheses can achieve rapid, on-demand growth of semiconductor nanowires. Importantly, the integration of nanowires into future device architectures will require a wide range of assembly strategies. While current solution-based nanowire assembly processes struggle to create deterministic heterojunctions, here, we demonstrate a novel example of nanowire assembly in a high-Prandtl-number organic solvent system, using an optical trap to orient, align, and "solder" metal-seeded semiconductor nanowires into periodic axial heterostructures. Finally, we investigate the role of surface functionalization on the integration of group-IV nanowires into high-capacity alloying electrodes for lithium ion batteries. We demonstrate that interfacial chemistry affects electrochemical access to different phases of lithiated germanium, and by carefully controlling the nanowire surface chemistry, we eliminate the need for the fluorinated electrolyte additives typically required for the stable cycling of group-IV-based, lithium-ion battery electrodes. In addition, we demonstrate that by balancing precursor decomposition kinetics, alloyed silicon-germanium (SiGe) nanowires can be synthesized through supercritical-fluid-based processes, potentially improving the rate capability of high-capacity silicon-based electrode materials produced via scalable processes. We anticipate that the information gained from these solution-based synthetic methods, assembly techniques, and surface chemistry studies will inform synthetic compositional control, elucidate relationships between solution-based reaction parameters and emergent properties, and advance the integration of solution-grown semiconductor nanowires into next-generation devices.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed May 18, 2020). 0aNanowires. 0aSemiconductors. 0aSilicon. 0aGermanium. 7aSilicon.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01118631 7aSemiconductors.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01112198 7aNanowires.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01032641 7aGermanium.2fast0(OCoLC)fst009420780 aAssembly0 aBatteries0 aNanowires0 aSemiconductor0 aSynthesis0 aChemical engineering0 aNanoscience 4aThesesxChemical engineering. 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aHolmberg, Vincent Carl,edegree supervisor.40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/45457  aWAUW03082cam a2200505 i 45000010011000000060019000110080041000300050017000710070014000880400046001021000038001482450143001862640063003292640011003923000089004033360026004923370026005183380036005443470021005803470008006015020049006095040055006585201165007135880094018786500028019726500014020006500024020146500040020386500050020786500054021286530027021826530025022096530024022346530035022586530017022936530026023106530016023366530025023526550034023776550047024116550028024587000044024868560037025300490009025671244554965m     o  d s      210402t20202020waua    obm  s000 0 eng d20210506221600.9cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdWAUdOCLCOdOCLCF1 aRamakrishnan, Shripathi,eauthor.10aHighly efficient all-polymer solar cells based on wide bandgap donor copolymers containing selenophene moieties /cShripathi Ramakrishnan. 1a[Seattle] :b[University of Washington Libraries],c[2020] 4c©2020  a1 online resource (2 unnumbered pages, v, 73 pages) :billustrations (chiefly color)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext file2rdaft  bPDF  bM.S.

Compared to PBDB-S, PBDBS-T displayed a narrower bandgap and red-shifted absorption owing to an upshifted HOMO by 0.13 eV. Both donors displayed significantly enhanced hole mobilities compared to PBDB-T, resulting in significantly higher photocurrent values of 17.51 mA/cm2 and 18.31 mA/cm2. Additionally, the superior crystallinity, and phase-separated morphology conferred by PBDBS-T resulted in efficient exciton dissociation and charge transport, enabling greater fill factors up to 63.5% and 9.5% efficiency. These results indicate that a selenophene p-spacer in a D-A polymeric backbone is beneficial to the photovoltaic properties, photophysics, and morphology of all-PSCs and is a promising molecular design strategy to develop highly efficient all-PSCs.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed April 2, 2021). 0aSolar cellsxMaterials. 0aPolymers. 0aSelenium compounds. 7aPolymers.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01070588 7aSelenium compounds.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01111416 7aSolar cellsxMaterials.2fast0(OCoLC)fst011249410 aAll-Polymer Solar Cell0 aCrystallinity tuning0 aDevice optimization0 aDonor polymer molecular design0 aPhotophysics0 aSelenophene pi-spacer0 aEngineering0 aChemical engineering 4aThesesxChemical engineering. 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aJenekhe, Samson A.,edegree supervisor.40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/46393  aWAUW03581cam a2200469 i 45000010011000000080041000110060019000520050017000710070014000880400044001021000036001462450105001822640063002872640011003503000068003613360026004293370026004553380036004813470021005173470008005385000010005465020044005565040041006005201846006415880093024876500026025806500026026066500025026326500027026576500052026846500053027366500052027896530025028416530022028666530025028886550034029136550047029476550028029947000043030228560037030650490009031021154646404200518t20202020waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20200716184204.8cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdWAUdOCLCFdOCL1 aRuskowitz, Emily Rose,eauthor.10aPhotochemical and logic-based regulation over the cellular microenvironment /cEmily Rose Ruskowitz. 1a[Seattle] :b[University of Washington Libraries],c[2020] 4c©2020  a1 online resource (vi, 150 pages) :billustrations (some color)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext file2rdaft  bPDF  aVita.  bPh.

By better understanding how well-defined combinations of individual biochemical signals including proteins presented in this space operate in (a)synchrony to direct cellular and integrated tissue function, we can begin to unravel irregularities within diseased systems and utilize this information to engineer therapies that promote healthy recovery. As photochemical reactions can be uniquely modulated in time and space, this dissertation develops and subsequently exploits novel light-based strategies to spatiotemporally control biochemical microenvironments and cellular signaling. First, we establish the cytocompatibility of near-ultraviolet light treatments common to photochemical manipulation through mammalian cell survival assays and global proteomic analyses. Expanding on existing concepts of photoresponsive drug delivery, we then introduce a generalizable strategy to govern biochemical signal presentation within biomaterials in response to precise combinations of environmental factors following user-programmable Boolean logic. Finally, we introduce the first genetically encoded protein-protein photoligation chemistry, and demonstrate its utility in irreversibly directing protein binding, function, and interactions both intra- and extracellularly. Employing this versatile photoreaction, we demonstrate 3D patterned immobilization of full-length proteins within biomaterials and user-guided intracellular protein activity. Such newly afforded 4D control over biological systems is expected to further basic biological understanding and advance medicine through enhanced tissue engineering and therapeutic delivery approaches.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed May 18, 2020). 0aBiomedical materials. 0aPhotonicsxMaterials. 0aPolymersxMaterials. 0aDrug delivery systems. 7aPhotonicsxMaterials.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01062075 7aDrug delivery systems.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00898667 7aBiomedical materials.2fast0(OCoLC)fst008325860 aBiomedical Materials0 aProtein Chemistry0 aChemical engineering 4aThesesxChemical engineering. 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aDeForest, Cole A.,edegree supervisor.40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/45455  aWAUW03429cam a2200445 i 45000010011000000080041000110060019000520050017000710070014000880400053001021000040001552450105001952640063003002640011003633000076003743360026004503370026004763380036005023470021005383470008005595020049005675040055006165201810006715880093024816500044025746500022026186530021026406530031026616530017026926530021027096530015027306530009027456530025027546550034027796550047028136550028028607000049028888560037029370490009029741244817250210405t20202020waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20210716171246.7cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdOCLCOdOCLCFdWAUdOCLCO1 aShackelford, David,d1992-eauthor.10aComparing machine learning classification methods for biological tracking data /cDavid Shackelford. 1a[Seattle] :b[University of Washington Libraries],c[2020] 4c©2020  a1 online resource (3 unnumbered pages, 49 pages) :bcolor illustrations  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  atext file2rdaft  bPDF  bM.S.

The additional use of machine learning (ML) methods has previously been proven successful in classifying both single particle tracking and MPT data for many biological systems. In order to further utilize collected MPT data for studies focused on nanoparticle diffusion within biological environments, a new predictive package, referred to as diff_predictor was developed in this study. This package uses feature and trajectory datasets, along with prediction methods such as XGBoost, recurrent neural networks, and random forest decision trees, to make predictions and classifications about the biological environment and nanoparticle behavior. To apply diff_predictor, I took a threefold approach: First, an extreme gradient boosting decision tree (XGBoost) was applied to a study of diffusion in a developing region within the brain to predict age based on spatial features. The features used in classification were analyzed for importance using Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) values. Second, a long short-term memory recurrent neural network algorithm was used on the temporal data from the same dataset and the results were compared with XGBoost and random forest models. Finally, demonstration of the versatility of the diff_predictor package showed we can classify regional differences in diffusion in the brain using a new different experimental dataset. The models produced by diff_predictor had accuracies up to 54.56% for prediction in age-based data, and accuracies up to 91.35% for prediction in regional-based data. Furthermore, SHAP values produced by the decision tree methods in diff_predictor provided useful information toward nanoparticle environment and interactions.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewedApril 5, 2021). 0aParticle dynamicsxMathematical models. 0aMachine learning.0 aMachine learning0 aMultiple Particle Tracking0 aNanoparticle0 aNanotherapeutics0 aPrediction0 aSHAP0 aChemical engineering 4aThesesxChemical engineering. 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aNance, Elizabeth,d1985-edegree supervisor.40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/46394  aWAUW05213cam a2200517 i 45000010011000000080041000110060019000520050017000710070014000880400044001021000032001462450153001782640063003312640011003943000072004053360026004773370026005033380036005293470021005653470008005865000010005945020044006045040057006485203269007055880093039746500028040676500023040956500023041186500022041416500049041636500049042126500054042616500048043156530025043636530021043886530029044096530014044386530018044526530019044706550034044896550047045236550028045707000051045988560037046490490009046861154647967200518t20202020waua    obm  s000 0 eng dm     o  d s      20200716184306.1cr ||||||||||  aWAUbengerdaepncWAUdWAUdOCLCFdOCL1 aStoddard, Ryan J.,eauthor.10aDevelopment of stable, high optoelectronic quality perovskites using photoluminescence, photoconductivity, and machine learning /cRyan J.

Reducing the cost of photovoltaics can be attained by improving power conversion efficiency, increasing module lifetime, and reducing processing and CAPEX costs. However, mature technologies such as silicon are presently approaching fundamental efficiency limits, and cost reductions have plateaued. Hybrid Perovskites (HPs) are an emerging material class that show promise since they are inexpensive to fabricate via solution processing, and they have broadly tunable material properties. The HP bandgap can be precisely tuned to pair with silicon in a tandem solar cell, increasing the theoretical power conversion efficiency limit with minimal additional processing costs. The work presented in this dissertation is broadly focused on improving the performance and reliability of perovskite materials for photovoltaic applications. First, I demonstrate a photoluminescence-photoconductivity (PL-PC) technique that directly measures HP quasi-Fermi level splitting ([Delta]E[subscript]F) and carrier diffusion length (L[subscript]D), which are predictors of device open-circuit voltage and short-circuit current respectively. I use this PC-PL technique to highlight several cases where [Delta]E[subscript]F and L[subscript]D are anti-correlated and show the importance of quantifying L[subscript]D in determining overall absorber optoelectronic quality. Next, I focus on development of high-bandgap HPs for tandem applications. Although halide mixing can increase the bandgap to make an ideal bandgap pairing with silicon in tandem applications, the mixed-halide HPs suffer from lower relative voltages and phase instabilities under illumination. Using high-throughput combinatorial exploration, I identified a new compositional motif using larger guanidinium and smaller cesium to form a stable HP structure with enhanced lattice strain. This class of mixed-halide HPs with enhanced strain show modified band structure, higher film [Delta]E[subscript]F, and device open-circuit voltage. I expanded the combinatorial exploration of HP compositions and collect a dataset of 13,000 photoluminescence (PL) spectra indexed by composition. Additionally, I show a proof of concept of using a machine learning approach to predict material bandgap and optoelectronic quality fraction. I also study the origin and impact of phase segregation in mixed-halide HPs and discover phase segregation occurs due to excess charge carriers, which can be generated either by photoexcitation or by current injection. Finally, I study degradation of HP films and devices in various combinations of light, atmosphere, humidity, and thermal stresses and use a machine learning model to link early time behavior to the time it takes the material or device to degrade. This effort reveals simple optical measurements such as transmittance and dark field microscopy have considerable utility in identifying early signs of HP degradation. Collectively, the work included in this dissertation demonstrates considerable progress toward understanding optoelectronic performance and reliability of a wide class of HP materials, with focus on high-bandgap HPs useful for tandem applications.0 aOnline resource; title from PDF title page (ResearchWorks Archive, viewed May 18, 2020). 0aPerovskite solar cells. 0aPhotoluminescence. 0aPhotoconductivity. 0aMachine learning. 7aPhotoluminescence.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01062036 7aPhotoconductivity.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01061530 7aPerovskite solar cells.2fast0(OCoLC)fst02009247 7aMachine learning.2fast0(OCoLC)fst010047950 aChemical Engineering0 aMachine Learning0 aOptoelectronic Materials0 aPhotonics0 aPhotovoltaics0 aSemiconductors 4aThesesxChemical engineering. 7aAcademic theses.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01726453 7aAcademic theses.2lcgft1 aHillhouse, Hugh W.,d1972-edegree supervisor.40uhttp://hdl.handle.net/1773/45458  aWAUW
